0 i was sadly mistaken .
0 so on to the hoagies , the italian is general run of the mill .
0 minimal meat and a ton of shredded lettuce .
0 nothing really special & not worthy of the $ _num_ price tag .
0 second , the steak hoagie , it is atrocious .
0 i had to pay $ _num_ to add cheese to the hoagie .
0 she told me there was a charge for the dressing on the side .
0 are you kidding me ?
0 i was not going to pay for the dressing on the side .
0 i ordered it without lettuce , tomato , onions , or dressing .
0 are you kidding me ?
0 i paid $ _num_ to add sauted mushrooms , onions , and cheese .
0 in this case , never .
0 ( the hoagie bun was better than average . )
0 wake up or you are going to lose your business .
0 this place has none of them .
0 it is april and there are no grass tees yet .
0 there is no grass on the range .
0 bottom line , this place sucks .
0 someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be .
0 very disappointed in the customer service .
0 we will not be back .
0 the iced tea is also terrible tasting .
0 used to go there for tires , brakes , etc .
0 plus , _num_ of the new tires went flat within _num_ weeks .
0 i was originally told it would take _num_ mins .
0 slow , over priced , i 'll go elsewhere next time .
0 they seem overpriced , too .
0 do n't waste your time .
0 not a call , not the estimate , nothing .
0 shortly after returning home she started to cough and gag like .
0 she was very uncomfortable .
0 at this point they were open and would be for another hour .
0 she has to wait _num_ days to be seen .
0 absolutely the worst care in all my experience with vets !
0 this place went from great to horrible .
0 noisy snow tires in the summer !
0 i told him they are too noisy .
0 very rude and once they get paid have no ethics .
0 i dropped off _num_ shirts at this establishment just before thanksgiving .
0 they have offered $ _num_ a shirt for the shirts they lost .
0 i would n't use their services again if you paid me to .
0 sign is blank and all fixtures from the store have been removed .
0 bread or not , it still was n't great .
0 it was a basic salad , no big deal .
0 i never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be .
0 nah ... why bother when there are so many other options around .
0 just do n't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds .
0 but apparently , mama has left the kitchen .
0 as for my mushroom and cheese omelette , the cheese was lacking .
0 if i wanted a microwave omelet i would have gone to burger king .
0 two scrambled whole eggs , italian toast , and home fries .
0 in a considerably nasty tone .
0 guess who was n't too busy , carnegie coffee company down the street .
0 it was hot in there and i do n't think they have ac .
0 it does n't say cash only anywhere inside or on the menu either .
0 there is an atm , but it has a $ _num_ charge to use .
0 ca n't believe a place in _num_ does n't take cards .
0 the coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate .
0 i fed my whole family breakfast ( _num_ of us ) for $ _num_ .
0 not to mention my allergies were in full effect .
0 the bathroom was so inconvenient to get in and out of .
0 i 'll be sure to spend my money elsewhere next time .
0 if i could give this place less than one star , i would .
0 apparently , we were out of luck .
0 it 's a tiny long bar just like the old irish pubs .
0 no more smoking allowed .
0 i really really want this place to do better .
0 we need more irish pubs and local old time watering holes .
0 whatever the case , they have cold guinness .
0 some of the worst pizza i 've ever had .
0 we used a coupon from the paper for a _num_ topping _num_ cut sicilian .
0 the onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can .
0 the veggies were old and wilted , and there was no dressing on either .
0 no flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam .
0 i have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed .
0 the business is not run the way it has been in the past .
0 this is probably the worst business in carnegie .
0 is it possible to give zero stars ?
0 the inside is very dated and appears to be poorly cared for .
0 it smelled like burnt fish when we walked in the door .
0 the fish was old and cold and fries were a very soft .
0 the corn lacked butter .
0 service was n't too bad - nice people .
0 unfortunately , there are only two reviews .
0 they did not acknowledge me .
0 the door i was at had signage ( open hours ) .
0 take it from me ; avoid this place at all cost .
0 does n't even taste good as american style chinese food .
0 i used to order takeout here once every month or so .
0 let alone one that the food is n't even that good .
0 also the inside is dirty as heck .
0 needless to say , we never returned .
0 otherwise i 'll have to have him put to sleep .
0 do n't take your cat here .
0 do n't waste your time or money at this denny 's .
0 i never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members .
0 i did n't feel welcome here .
0 but it 's not well maintained .
0 but my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit .
0 but it was n't just the knowledge of the menu .
0 there was no one filling up water .
0 my biggest complaint , however , is what happened with our meals .
0 so , he took the meals back to the kitchen .
0 they did n't remake anything .
0 quite frankly , the fish was n't good at all .
0 the guy never really even apologized for the mistake .
0 coming here you get the feeling they have n't changed much .
0 does that make you a little worried ?
0 ambiance , like i said , left much to be desired .
0 consider where this place is , the prices are really really high .
0 nothing is served on the side with main dishes ... .
0 papa j 's is expensive and inconsistent .
0 there are better restaurants in carnegie .
0 it was so disgusting i could n't eat it .
0 not a ton of flavor there either .
0 his broccoli was rock hard - like wood !
0 and the chicken was very dry .
0 i have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times .

0 my food was cold and bland , my kids food was cold .
0 bad food , slow service and rude managers .
0 papa j 's is no longer the only game in town .
0 obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management .
0 my husband & i ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time .
0 my lettuce was drowning in the vinegar .
0 my husband 's pasta had even less flavor than mine .
0 we ate about a quarter of the food & could n't even finish it .
0 and i hate wasting food !
0 do n't waste your time eating here .
0 there are much better italian restaurants in pittsburgh .
0 well , papa j 's has officially priced itself out of our budget .
0 $ _num_ per salad ?
0 it 's lettuce , cheese , and pine nuts !
0 $ _num_ / salad ?
0 our pizza was cold and our drinks where empty .
0 we are not going back .
0 it rather looks like a deli counter .
0 a bit confusing layout , but tastefully done .
0 the dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant .
0 there was no salad or pasta side offered .
0 this alone i would have given _num_ stars .
0 he appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time .
0 however , i think i would try somewhere else to dine .
0 why the hell was there a wait ?
0 the older man that took us to the table could have done nicer .
0 the food was not bad but it was not good .
0 the chicken piccata was flavorful , but not as expected .
0 it had no signs of being coated and sauted to a rich golden brown .
0 no pasta was served with the chicken .
0 the side of vegetables were well cooked , buy again lacked any real flavor .
0 the total was $ _num_ and change .
0 my friend ordered veal and they brought him sausage .
0 the waitress was extremely rude .
0 too many good restaurants in that area to tolerate bad attitude !
0 that is where the efficiency and service took a turn for the worst .
0 we sat for _num_ minutes before a server came to our table .
0 at that point , she said i 'll grab you water and bread .
0 however , we ordered the veal stuffed banana peppers which arrived cold .
0 we also ordered the `` incredible white pizza '' which was incredibly cold .
0 while patrick stepped up the service the entire experience was fairly terrible .
0 also , i wrote to the restaurant and received no response .
0 for $ _num_ a person it was terrible .
0 i got the shrimp and veal and my veal was dry .
0 i ordered a drink _num_ times and never got it .
0 i 'll probably never go back again .
0 worst service of all time .

0 okay , shame on us for not asking .
0 potatoes or pasta are always included with marsala .
0 never ever again will we return here .
0 the worst dental experience of my life .
0 i have never been so uncomfortable in my life .
0 save yourself a lot of time , money and pain .
0 no one should have to go thru what i am currently going thru .
0 the worst dental office i ever been .
0 you should avoid it at any time .
0 would not have my dogs teeth cleaned here !
0 this place is one of the worst dental offices i 've ever walked into .
0 i 've never posted a yelp review before .
0 no sign of italian meat to be found .
0 you may want to consider having the pizza delivered .
0 my expectations for mcdonalds are t rarely high .

0 people were getting refunds wait time was so long .
0 soda is watered down and gross .
0 rude staff doesnt know what they are doing .
0 just skip this one and you will be better off .
0 seating inside is very limited .

0 and there 's hardly any tables to sit at .
0 this has never happened before and it took me off guard .
0 the barista came off dishonest and unfriendly with the up sell push .
0 i will avoid this one at the waterfront for awhile .
0 with all of the other options in the area , take your money elsewhere !
0 finally , i find one after _num_ minutes of wondering around .
0 this is not the first time i 've been hard up to find help .
0 the store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere .
0 however , if you 're looking for something specific , good luck .
0 i usually only stop there if i 'm already at tend waterfront .
0 not at this location .
0 this is the absolute worst steak n shake i 've ever been to .
0 the bf and i got lost around pittsburgh for _num_ min .
0 wish i had looked it up earlier .
0 the only thing worse than the food is the service .
0 there were several things that got me annoyed , one after another .
0 but the food came cold .
0 we were so hungry by that point , we just ate whatever we could .
0 neither angel nor anyone else came to top up our drinks even once .
0 might have been a stomach bug but it is kind of strange .
0 terrible wait staff could n't even seat us .
0 def not worth the wait .
0 i really like the chili .
0 burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad .
0 pretty hard to mess up a side salad .
0 as others have said you never know what kind of service you will get .
0 store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair .
0 cheap and crap service .
0 unfortunately the service is very hit or miss .
0 the service is awful .
0 the service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service .
0 i sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared .
0 it was all i could taste .
0 tonight they told me that the drive thru was closed .
0 i have never , ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom .
0 this one , however , leaves a lot to be desired .
0 most of the time , they 're downright rude .
0 this location is terrible .
0 the drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food .
0 she then told me it only comes with cheese .
0 so i then went on to tell her what i wanted on my burger .
0 the meat is badly burned and cold .
0 it was clear to me this burger was not fresh .
0 the service is the worst i 've ever seen .
0 i do n't know how corporate keeps this place open .
0 i 've complained numerous times but it never does any good .

0 food is cheap but portions are small .
0 also the restaurant is not really clean either .
0 this restaurant is not my number _num_ choice .
0 i really do n't know how this place stays open .
0 on our last visit it took us _num_ minutes to get our waitresses attention .
0 it took _num_ minutes to get the mustard and mayo .
0 our waitress was very polite , though .
0 i have eaten here before and never had any problems .
0 they completely ignored us so we got up and left .

0 waitress was rude to them and the manager never came to address the issue .
0 five guy burgers much better .
0 this is the worst place i 've maybe ever been to .
0 the outside was filthy with trash all over .
0 the inside was maybe worse , trash and dirty .
0 the employees were awful , rude , slow and not caring about a thing .
0 i ca n't even guess how unsanitary it might be .
0 i keep forgetting how not good this location is .
0 i only returned because i was getting my dog groomed at the nearby petco .
0 actually there was nothing basement like about it .
0 what will be done with the empty space that is the question ?
0 $ _num_ for a red bull and vodka ?
0 in my opinion , sing sing is really not worth it .
0 the music the guys played was all stuff from like _num_ .
0 i would not recommend anybody go .
0 this place has gone significantly down hill .
0 however , each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller .
0 very slow and boring .
0 save your $ _num_ and skip this place .
0 we had reservations , which was good because it was packed that saturday night .
0 why should it , those computers are always making mistakes .
0 what was originally an average lowe 's has turned into lowe 's hell .
0 we would be paying several hundred dollars to get the doors installed .
0 after the installation , lowe 's would refund us the $ _num_ .
0 i told him we would like our $ _num_ back .
0 i can not believe how unprofessional this store was !
0 goodbye lowes ... hello home depot !
0 so much rudeness -- checking out and trying to find other items .
0 clearly there are zero expectations for customer service here .
0 our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that .
0 the potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing .
0 if you are going to order something , i would go with the pizza .
0 we also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good , also .
0 she sent it back .
0 no quick and easy app or beers on the house .
0 to boot , the beer was pretty expensive .
0 the biggest downfall of duke 's , though , is the food .

0 i ate two of the _num_ tenders ( seven ! )
0 i gave up and refused the offer for another .

0 $ _num_ for a banana split cocktail ?
0 waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts .
0 trying to get something healthy , i ordered the apple pecan salad .
0 i could barely eat the salad .
0 perhaps next time we 'll just stop by for drinks instead .
0 i guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene .
0 the food was absolutely gross !
0 first of all the sandwich was on sliced bread ( lame ) !
0 mixed drinks are way too pricey for the location .
0 the food is crap .
0 this time , it was ridiculous .
0 on top of that , the customer service sucked .
0 for $ _num_ , it was n't worth it .
0 our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted .
0 _num_ beer per hour maximum .
0 avoid at all costs .
0 here 's where it gets bad .
0 _num_ mins later we get our refills .
0 mind you , our food still has n't came yet .
0 finally , _num_ mins later ... that 's one hour , folks .
0 yep , the food was cold .
0 the only compensation we got were $ _num_ game cards .
0 after spending over $ _num_ plus games , we will never go back .
0 it was a saturday !
0 _num_ bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full .
0 all i have to say is get your crap together .
0 for how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends .
0 apathetic service staff all around , the peanut and i were really disappointed .
0 wo n't be back .
0 let me tell you about my bad experience first .
0 i was just really turned off from that experience .
0 lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people !
0 i will not be back again to eat .
0 the outside breading was hard as a rock and had no taste .
0 the fish itself was bland .
0 i was thinking he would have stopped but did n't oh well .
0 sometime you just get one that is n't .
0 this place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms .
0 when our food came though , everything was below average .
0 did n't see a manager until after 10:30 pm .
0 needless to say , we did n't stay to eat and went elsewhere .
0 it 's the customers fault your staff ca n't handle a sat night rush .
0 i will never spend money here again !
0 took _num_ minutes to even be acknowledged .
0 first off , service was horrible .
0 it took about _num_ minutes , minimum , to get our first drinks .
0 my boyfriend had their philly cheesesteak and he could n't finish it .
0 was so salty and just not good .
0 for the price of everything , it was not worth it all .
0 you 'll save $ $ , time , and frustration !
0 everything was pretty picked over , which kinda sucked .
0 so we again go off in search of someone to help .
0 it also was n't the cleanest place i 've ever seen .
0 and not well maintained or managed at all .
0 over priced , over hyped but a hell of a time regardless .
0 i ate here for lunch today with my wife and _num_ kids .
0 server was prompt getting to the table , took our order and then disappeared .
0 grilled cheese , salad and a quesadilla should n't take that long .
0 mens room did n't have any paper towels to dry hands with .
0 huge fail for this type of venue .
0 service is n't too bad , but could be better .
0 i also thing d & b is n't the cleanest place either .
0 the bathrooms near the arcade are always nasty in my opinion .
0 does n't seem like they keep up with it .
0 to me , thats a big factor in rating restaurants .
0 this was n't the cleanest place .
0 dirty paper towels all over the women 's bathroom .
0 also they are n't following corporate policy .
0 very disappointed in his attitude more then anything .
0 the food here is awful .
0 i only gave it _num_ stars because i liked my mac and cheese .
0 everyone else at the table hated their food .
0 all i have to say is no thanks .
0 i 'd hate to be there when they are `` busy '' .
0 worst service i 've ever had !
0 we left and nothing was even said about why we never got our food .
0 while sitting there we noticed _num_ other parties walked out as well .
0 they did n't even get their drinks .
0 i would recommend that if you go there never sit and eat .
0 the food was bad .
0 the bathrooms smelled like stale urine and the floors were very sticky .
0 the waitress was nice but overall i would n't dine here again .
0 if you are under _num_ you must be accompanied by a _num_ year old .

0 even managers saw us sitting there and didnt bother to greet us .
0 we will still go here just not try to eat .
0 i am _num_ and my sisters are younger than i am .
0 which i was , and i was not allowed in .
0 avoid eating or drinking anything here .
0 the service was terrible .
0 especially multiple employees , hostesses , waitresses , and bus boys .
0 either way , on a saturday night , i would n't recommend going here .
0 nina the manager and ashley the cashier extremely rude .
0 highly recommend that no one ever goes here .
0 our service was awful as well .
0 i do n't think i have one good thing to say about this place .
0 she brought a pile of beverage napkins .
0 but that 's not the worst .
0 despite pointing out the problem , she never did do anything about that .
0 anyway , do n't try to eat here .
0 just come and play the games , but skip the food .
0 i wish there were no kids .
0 she was definitely old enough to understand why she was wrong .
0 how ridiculous for an arcade game company to turn away kids .
0 if they had a negative star would have selected the worst rating .
0 _num_ hour wait and then cold food served .
0 did not have enough staff in kitchen and never bothered to provide updates .
0 nothing positive to say other than do n't go there .
0 ghetto , the server kept calling me baby all night .
0 waited _num_ minutes for our drinks and an additional _num_ minutes for our food .
0 i could understand if they were busy , but it was n't at all .
0 the food was n't very good at all .
0 i 've never sent back food , ever , but this was ridiculous .
0 the server takes my plate , and says they would make it right .
0 ca n't say much for an office that is managed this way .
0 the lack of empathy was even more disturbing .
0 do n't take it out on the person they are incorrectly calling .
0 the frosty is never frosty always runny .
0 `` nah '' it was _num_ .
0 cant rate the food cause i have n't received any .
0 but since its _num_ guess they are closed .
0 if there was a way to give no stars i would .
0 so we called back and asked for our money back .
0 if you want terrible pizza go here .
0 not worth one star !
0 - original pretzel appetizer .
0 the half order of ribs looked like a full rack .
0 - lots of food choices ... burgers ... steak ... chicken ... salads .
0 lots of drink choices ... beers ... wines ... mixed drinks .
0 - none of the food was super awesome .
0 nothing was awful , but nothing stood out in any way .
0 - kind of dead on a monday night with 3/4 of the place empty .
0 head next door to sing sing for drinks , though .
0 the low point lately has been the food .
0 unfortunately rock bottom is one that falls into that category .
0 it 's pretty much a crap shoot .
0 unfortunately , it seems there is zero attention to food quality .
0 till then , it 's hit or miss !
0 i must admit , i do like the brews .
0 i also like the white cheddar mash potatoes .
0 other than that , meh .
0 the food is pretty forgettable .
0 not worth $ _num_ unfortunately the sausage platter was $ _num_ .
0 the restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table .
0 i have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable .
0 their food is pretty much like their beers , forgettable .
0 here 's where i ran into problems .
0 it was very greasy and had virtually no crab .
0 the service was ok , not the best not the worst .
0 if i was n't so hungry i would n't have eaten them at all !
0 the husband had the bbq chicken pizza .
0 it blew my crappy tacos out of the water !
0 and the underwhelming food sealed the deal .
0 poor service and food .
0 i waited _num_ minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence .
0 so i had to wait an additional _num_ minutes to find someone to pay .
0 on to the important part ... food was terrible .
0 i had a burger and it was pathetic .
0 otherwise , you are better off skipping it .
0 unfortunately the reality did n't match the idea of the burger .
0 it was like having a standard old boring burger .
0 i was very disappointed .
0 for $ _num_ , i would have expected a lot more flavor .
0 but yes , you guessed it , that 's overpriced too .
0 the food was uninspired , tired , and ordinary .
0 spicy and thick it went down easy enough .
0 the steak consisted of three small thinly sliced pieces of ... .
0 not the best dinner they have eaten .
0 it was filing hot and load with chicken and bacon .
0 over all this meal was a wash .
0 corporate decided to get rid of the core beers and the beers now suck .
0 the service has also suffered tremendously .
0 i do n't expect this rock bottom to be around too much longer .
0 i could not even finish half of mine .
0 if i were to go back , it certainly would not be to eat .
0 meh is the only thing i leave here feeling .
0 i ordered the classic burger because nothing on the new menu excited me .
0 it was topped with an olive and a mini pickle ... odd .
0 my `` squash '' side was lacking squash .
0 instead all squash was replaced by peppers ... which i can not eat .
0 i 'm very disappointed to say this place has gone down hill .
0 every time we are seated in the dining area it 's a bad experience .
0 i tried to steal a few of his fries , which were a failure .
0 on my own dish i had the classic mac n ' chicken .
0 and when i say smothered here , this is not a good thing .
0 everything else , avoid .
0 first bad experience at this place .
0 double swiss burger was as tasteless as they could make .
0 i asked for medium cooked and they gave me burnt .
0 instead of caramelized onions , they added raw onions .
0 the waiter did not even bother to ask if everything was okay .
0 wo n't visit again .
0 overall , it was a mediocre experience with forgettable food .
0 i wo n't be going back .
0 my boyfriend 's bison burger was not that tasty either he sent it back .
0 very disappointed with this place .
0 do not come here to eat .
0 _num_ stars because the beer was good .
0 no salsa , no lettuce , guac , sour cream .
0 it was so underwhelming .
0 i wish the food could match the quality of their beer .
0 if you want rock bottom food , head to rock bottom .
0 slow service , horrible , horrible food .
0 was served freezing cold enchiladas and pizza .
0 terrible customer service , disrespectful in fact .
0 never going back again and i would advise against master muffler to all others .
0 second , the sodas are not free refills !
0 but the biggest problem is the food and drink .
0 _num_ - a lot of the drinks did n't have prices on them .
0 it 's not that hard .
0 _num_ - put the drink prices on the website too .
0 not all the prices are on the website , which makes for difficult planning .
0 the food , however , is mediocre at best .
0 i could not see a thing .
0 it was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl .
0 it looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked .
0 it was n't edible .
0 it does n't even have to be memorable ... just not offensive .
0 but damn , i was hungry !
0 i feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole .
0 i 'd give the comedians _num_ stars , and the food zero stars .
0 no , i do n't want you to take our food back !
0 is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on ?
0 the service did n't get any better .
0 the food was lousy .
0 one of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich .
0 but hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable .
0 we also sent an order of chicken fingers back ... dryer than sand .
0 overpriced , shitty food and drinks .
0 hell , tgi friday 's would have been better .
0 they did n't let people in because they claimed the room was not ready .
0 seating is first come , first served .
0 whoever designed this place should be shot .
0 there is no lobby to hold people before a show .
0 there is no question that it has everything you could want .
0 that 's where the praise ends .
0 and it 's not just coffee , and not just target .
0 they 're banking on this lack of competition .
0 now , maybe you do n't care .
0 they clearly do n't bring them in at the end of the night .
0 the lack of customer service in this regard is atrocious .
0 walmart does n't even make you do that !
0 this was an expensive skirt , completely ruined .
0 just do n't take your dry cleaning here .
0 costco was closed so i went to giant eagle .
0 do n't waste your time , or risk your health .

0 there were fruit flies everywhere .
0 because of number two our service in general was not good .
0 the _num_ of us got to bar louie at 8:30 .
0 i wo n't be going back .
0 i very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first .
0 outside of that bar louie leaves a lot to be desired .
0 to me , that is beyond ridiculous .
0 the absolute worst service i have ever had at any bar or restaraunt .
0 and , in looking at other reviews , i am not the first .
0 it was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing .
0 servers are chatting , not paying attention to tables .
0 it 's expensive , the food is so so .
0 there were also plenty of empty tables .
0 this should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction .
0 the server was nice , that is not the issue .
0 the issue was how grossly understaffed they were .
0 our server , was friendly .
0 my husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me .
0 both drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol .
0 bobby and i came here after dinner and sat up at the bar .
0 maybe i 'm just salty about the wait .

0 mortified by this , my wife and i quickly finished and left .
0 the drinks are very expensive but that 's every bar louie .
0 i spent almost _num_ minutes for some nachos .

0 the weekdays are bad enough .
0 i 'm looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer .

0 just sad there customer service sucks .
0 my sister for a deal for _num_ and day in the _num_ season .

0 people are rude there as well .
0 some horse play and such .
0 i really hate this place .
0 all of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go .
0 just when we thought the worst was over we were wrong .
0 so after several more wrong turns we finally get home .
0 otherwise , i would suggest staying far , far away !

0 fried rice super bland .

0 the wait staff did n't even acknowledge our party of _num_ .
0 my experience at this friday 's was not what i was expecting .
0 this beer is like champaign and it makes my whole stomach nice and cold .
0 why was my beer warm ?
0 better than that , why was my pot sticker appetizer in my beer ?
0 i did not find this funny at all !
0 i really do n't know why i bother with chain restaurants anymore .
0 when the salad arrived , it did not look like the picture .

0 i really never want to return .
0 food was ok had a steak w/ shrimp side ass mashed potatoes .
0 the menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive .

0 possibly the worst overpriced pizza there is .
0 service was just barely adequate on this visit .
0 it sure is n't the food .

0 we woke up late and missed the breakfast hours of our favorite place .
0 it was around 11:30 and the restaurant was mostly empty .
0 it was ok but not something i would order again .
0 my husband 's salad , italian chopped , was better .
0 it had huge chunks of tomatoes , sausage , and cheese .
0 for something that took so long to get it should have been hot .
0 i managed one bite and was done .
0 what we came away with from this experience is to leave .
0 do n't try to stay when the experience is that bad .

0 i have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before .
0 i have never visited a store with such a bad staff .
0 i hate this place .

0 it was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died .
0 but it 's soooooo bland !
0 they were also playing _num_ year old pop music really loud .
0 come on -- this is an `` asian bistro . ''
0 i was extremely disappointed by the lack of presentation .
0 our party arrived about _num_ minutes before our 5:30 reservations .
0 however it was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck .
0 i get there , look at their giant selection and get excited .
0 we sat at the bar and the female bartender was miserable .
0 we ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did .

0 the phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door .
0 did n't say a word to us .

0 the only thing this place has going for itself is the decor .
0 the service was not that professional !
0 the service was terrible .
0 we waited almost _num_ minutes for water glasses to be brought to the table .

0 when we got to the table , we were hoping for a better experience .
0 there were no complaints with the chicken , the only star of this evening .
0 the beef was disappointing to say the very least .
0 my only regret is i can not leave a 1/2 star rating .
0 it was bitter cold outside .
0 i asked our server why they had n't mentioned this when we came in .
0 i quickly ate and left to make my movie .

0 i 'm not against p.f .
0 chicken was very tough .
0 my boyfriend ordered the hot fish , but it was way too salty .

0 really , you do n't get much for what you pay for at panera .
0 its not very good at all .
0 service here is pretty bad .
0 i ordered chicken tortellini pasta and chicken noodle soup .

0 it did not even look appetizing .
0 stopped by sunday morning .
0 the light roast coffee was cold .
0 the steak was ice cold .
0 the slice of tomato that i had them add was not ripe .

0 yuk , i said that 's disgusting people have to eat that .
0 she reluctantly gave me the owners name .
0 service here has gone considerably downhill .

0 i just felt i was rushed out of there .
0 am i the only one ?
0 target reminds me of hills when i was a kid .
0 my experience here was not great at all .
0 watch out when it looks like something is on sale .
0 white slim fit shirt looked ridiculous .
0 his jacket did n't fit and his white shirt was worse than mine .
0 he said , oh about $ _num_ or $ _num_ .
0 i 'm shocked , never thought men 's dress clothes were so pricey .
0 first of all , the store was messy .
0 okay , i get it , they work on commission , but seriously .
0 needless to say , she would n't leave us alone .
0 my husband said , i 'm looking for some dress shirts and pants .
0 if it would have been me alone , i would have walked out .
0 however , i knew my husband wanted to use the gift card .
0 i did n't get it .
0 continuing on , check out was a nightmare !
0 it 's not that delish .
0 this store has such bad service .
0 the service staff are rude rude rude .
0 save your money , shop elsewhere .
0 i love bbb ; however , this location is terrible .
0 maybe they should pay me for this responsibility .
0 my gut just tells me not to trust e 'n ps .
0 so i wind up washing my hands after getting my salad stuff .

0 there are better places to eat for the same money .
0 it seemed like every single employee was around _num_ years old .

0 does n't matter what time we go .
0 get your hosts and servers on the same page !
0 poor service from the door .
0 i walked in and was ignored .
0 possibly the worst dining experience i 've had .
0 she simply said that sometimes they are n't told when someone is seated outside .
0 extremely slow service and a rude waitress on top of it .
0 this has to be the worst restaurant at the waterfront .
0 it is appalling to see what that place has become .
0 i will never go back to that place again .
0 unfortunately , that was the high point of this service .
0 the waitress there are extremely rude .
0 had to wait _num_ minutes before our waiter to even acknowledge us .
0 he then was really rude and never gave us napkins or forks .
0 did n't get any refills .
0 the coffee was stale .
0 i recently went into this eat n park and had a horrible experience .

0 five minutes later the $ _num_ easter special came out .
0 he was very rude to us .
0 his poor management skills and rude behavior ruined our holiday .
0 the restaurant was about half full , i was with one other person .
0 chef 's special was penne in a light alfredo sauce with crab and shrimp .

0 never did get a refill on iced tea .
0 sorry to see this place go down hill .
0 may not ever go back .
0 will not eat here again .
0 party involved said it was fine and asked me not to say something .
0 it was good thing we was on vacation so we had time to waste .
0 unfortunately service and excellent service should go hand and hand .
0 the quality is completely gone , portions are smaller , prices higher .
0 the server even tried pushing a diners club program on us !
0 why would anyone even pay for such lousy food ?
0 the place is not even kept up anymore .

0 her reply `` no .
0 it was n't terrible , inedible food , it was just ... .
0 the only thing that seemed to have any flavor was the rice .

0 a few uninterested waiters wandering in back .
0 we finally just walked out to go elsewhere .

0 after further consideration , this store does not deserve a _num_ star review .
0 i do n't see to many options in pittsburgh for sporting goods .

0 the owner has to be the problem .
0 worst mcdonald 's ever .
0 this review is more for the repair end of bbb .
0 where i am at , really there is no delivery but these guys did .
0 this crust , while thin , did not have flavor and was hard .
0 _num_ stars for being cheap and delivering .
0 the pizza , even when plain , is very greasy .
0 usually pizza that greasy is caused by low quality cheese .
0 also they do not take credit or debit cards .

0 when i started to eat , it tasted just as odd .
0 sorry allison b , ai n't no butter here .

0 the patty was sorta flavorful .
0 the toppings were in the bland category .
0 giant eagle is one of pittsburgh 's more expensive grocery chains .
0 management there does n't care !
0 visit another club , this one is n't it !
0 the service , on the other hand , was terrible .
0 avoid at all costs .
0 arrangement was just ok .
0 i will not order from this place again .
0 i would give our experience zero stars .
0 whatever it was , it was gross .
0 the chicken nuggets come out under par .
0 i recently posted a photo of my chicken ranch club .
0 that has no chicken .
0 delivery is slow and not even close to the best chinese in the area .
0 try house of lee instead .

0 but when it does , you bend over backwards to make it right .
0 not at this place .
0 this family of _num_ wo n't be visiting china sea ever again .
0 the woman who answers the phone is kinda rude .
0 yes this is also a con because i threw it away .
0 just very greasy , very salty , poor excuse for chinese takeout .
0 i was hung up on twice before i could even get my order out .
0 that 's why i gave it two stars instead of one .
0 if you have any common sense at all , please do n't stay here .
0 do not stay here .
0 i ca n't even rate this place !
0 i was forced to stay a night here and it was so disgusting !
0 i woke up with bed bug bites all over my body !

0 off to star nails we went .
0 unfortunately , the good feelings did n't last long .
0 i hate to rate a local shop down , but man my toes hurt .
0 i was rushed out and my polish was n't even hard yet .
0 while the place itself looked clean , the stylist 's rolling cart was not .
0 if i could give negative stars , i would .
0 ordered two spicy chicken combos yesterday at around _num_ o'clock .
0 worst fast food i 've ever been to .
0 after taking her to another vet , i was educated about wound care .
0 after she was treated properly , she healed quickly .
0 he cried constantly when i left his sight .
0 hoping to get a different vet next time i took my other cat there .
0 you try holding a scared cat in a room full of dogs .
0 my pet 's annual visit was over well $ _num_ .
0 also , do not take their facebook page seriously .
0 they do not care about animals .
0 i am not changing my review nor am i removing it .
0 they do not care about animals , at all .
0 this vet is only out for the money .
0 an average price , i 'm ok with that .
0 i think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients !
0 i could n't believe it .
0 this place is the worst , and i have never even stepped inside !
0 i needed a cut so i went for it anyway .
0 pie looked it it was sitting out for a day or _num_ .
0 i will not return to this place again .
0 shame on you lincoln to run a bakery like this .
0 almost all of the tires sold on site are foreign .
0 i 'm sorry , but you get one star for that .
0 i ended up buying american tires for the same price elsewhere .
0 everytime i eat at this location i end up with a sick stomach .
0 i do n't have that problem at other arby 's .
0 it was even slightly cold before i reheated it .
0 neither the brown sugar bacon and beef nor the blt had much bacon .
0 for a sandwich advertised to have delicious bacon , this fell way short .
0 the little bit of bacon it did have was burnt .
0 overall , this made a horrible day worse .
0 based on this experience , i would not go back .
0 based on this experience , i would most definitely not recommend this to others .
0 this store sucks beyond belief !
0 second of all , and more important , the service here is terrible .
0 you 're not doing as any favors by staying here .
0 first , i 'll walk you through my experience .
0 the customers and the staff are miserable at red white and blue .
0 the clothes are priced far higher than other such shops .
0 do n't waste your time or money !
0 there are much better places to shop for thrift in pittsburgh !
0 i have never been treated so terrible in my whole life .
0 deciding not to get it , i placed it on a near by shelf .
0 i handed it to her and walked out .
0 i do n't shop at stores that hire such terrible staff .
0 they really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room .
0 my boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich , which he loved .
0 i however , ordered the steak and cheese pita and was extremely disappointed .
0 the pita was soft and fresh but the steak was terrible .
0 when i picked up the sandwich grease poured from it .
0 needless to say i do n't think i will be returning .
0 this place is overpriced and the service is not good at all .
0 not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby .
0 we will not be back .
0 if i could give dr. murphy less than _num_ star , i absolutely would .
0 the new dentist could n't believe that !
0 do not go here -- find another dentist .
0 tonight , we walked in and went up to the counter with our beer .
0 no `` thank you '' or `` have a good day '' .
0 it was a weird experience .
0 i had a very unfortunate experience with this groomer .

0 not tasty at all .
0 never received my order and was left in a bad mood .
0 the sweet and sour chicken was disgusting .

0 i wish there was a zero star option to give .
0 first off , everything was dripping everywhere .
0 the entire bag was a soggy mess .
0 i 'm not even sure they bothered to cook that .

0 holy bat balls did this place have bad food !
0 nothing but flavorless , americanized chinese food .
0 very kind , gave me minor changes without question .

0 i could n't even pick them up .
0 watery sauce , no heat .
0 the worst part of it all .
0 see pics of giant balls of noodles that tasted like the burnt curry .
0 price does n't matter to me at all , though .
0 it was just inedible .
0 all noodle , no filler .
0 avoid if you want anything but americanized junk food .
0 unfortunately i did not get to experience these things .
0 the service was slow and lukewarm .
0 also , no credit or debit cards here .
0 i also ordered provolone sticks which also did not taste good .
0 i 've tried a lot of pizza places and this is so bad .
0 the crust is not homemade , pretty sure .

0 i am definitely going elsewhere next time .
0 this place has the worst service i 've ever seen .
0 i called in two cold sandwiches and was told it would be _num_ mins .

0 $ _num_ , including tip .
0 even with this voucher i feel like i paid too much money .
0 this shell station is horrible .
0 _num_ ) this place is ghetto .
0 it 's frustrating because they also do n't particularly need to work hard .
0 zero effort , and a horrible attitude .
0 it 's a gas station , how hard can it be ?
0 it 's clear that they do not care at all .
0 i 'm never going back , and you should n't either .
0 do not use their car wash .
0 this was a big mistake .
0 i was rear ended at a stop sign , was n't my fault .
0 i would n't recommend them to anyone .
0 called two days later to confirm it was ready .
0 `` no , it 's not ready yet .
0 days passed and no call .
0 left and halfway home , `` check engine '' light came back on .
0 please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards .
0 so now i have a very sick kitten on my hands .
0 this also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future .
0 no `` i 'm sorry . ''
0 they kill more pets for space than any other pittsburgh shelter .
0 this is a terrible shelter .
0 that 's probably how they got so sick !
0 my poor baby went through hell .
0 never again will i take my dog there .
0 she was sick six ways to sunday .
0 i hate that place and everyone in it .
0 i 'm very disappointed .
0 so i have no gripe with the tailoring itself .
0 so beware , you are paying to dollar !
0 i was in a time crunch , so paid anyways .
0 my suit coat came back ruined !
0 at that point , i had n't put two and two together yet .
0 so i went back first thing the next day , and showed the tailor .
0 it makes no sense .
0 i 'm just not crazy about the vibe here .
0 let me repeat , never again .
0 the primary reason i used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions .
0 hence , i am now here , writing this review .
0 the times i 've been here , its been an ok experience .
0 however , their store hours are absolutely terrible .
0 this place is a disaster .
0 it 's almost been _num_ hours and i 'm still waiting .
0 -they did not install tires correctly .
0 booked an appointment , and they fixed the issue .
0 i do not recommend .
0 last time i ever set foot in that place .
0 i will not be returning in the future .
0 went in to have a slow leak fixed on a tire .
0 no one could look at it because they had an appointment at _num_ .
0 one person working and could n't look at my car .
0 no appointments available for tomorrow .
0 poor service that leaves tenants to fight mildew on their own .
0 was trying to find a rating lower than _num_ star but could n't .
0 this guy seems nice but he 's actually not .
0 something does n't sound right here .
0 the light fixtures were too modern to be considered cozy .
0 the people who work here are very rude .
0 i am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there .
0 i will not go back again .
0 a little pricey but whatever .
0 the sandwich was just gross .
0 the coffee was just a little off .
0 no wonder mine was stale .
0 seriously , all the people here have major attitude problems and need an adjustment .
0 their sandwiches taste terrible as well , they 've always been terrible .
0 seriously , fuck this place .
0 i just do n't get why the floor is like and ice skating rink .
0 i drink this beer regularly , and something was wrong with the beer .
0 i 've had the pork nachos and they were blah .
0 our server was friendly , but not terribly attentive .
0 i would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night .
0 i ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions .
0 it is a shame because buffalo blues does have potential .
0 the sandwich left something to be desired .
0 buffalo blues was neither .
0 not particularly interested in returning for any reason .
0 very classy , wish i could remember her name .
0 bar food none too exceptional .
0 we had nachos that were on slightly stale chips .
0 it was humongous but not that tasty , pretty dry .
0 it really is a pittsburgh staple but come on ... .
0 food is really , really average .
0 it , technically is in shadyside so your mercedes will be safe !
0 it 's loud as hell !
0 there seems to be no consideration for customers at all .
0 but as long as they got their money ; they could give a crap .
0 want to sit in the bar area ?
0 also it 's loud as hell !
0 to put it lightly ; the staff suck !
0 it pains me to leave any tip for them .
0 it is way too expensive .
0 oh how the mighty have fallen .
0 something happened and the wings are small dry and just generally bad .
0 since wings are supposed to be their thing this is pretty unacceptable .
0 food is very overpriced though .
0 and , its not good .
0 some of the salads are alright , but its just not good food .
0 we did n't eat anything so i ca n't comment on the food .
0 my husband and i went to buffalo blues last night .
0 after what seemed like forever , my husband got up to find a server .
0 he literally walked around the restaurant to find someone , but could n't .
0 when we said no she said she would be back .
0 such a waste of time .
0 i hate this place .
0 so the max you could eat is _num_ wings .
0 the wings do not come with celery .
0 apparently this was a bad choice .
0 however , i hate it because i believe the alcohol and food is overpriced .
0 so , it 's not really much of a win at all .
0 unfortunately , the service we were given ruined our overall experience at buffalo blues .
0 my husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap .
0 the restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar .
0 we will not be back .
0 the food was awful , the service worse .
0 we ate two each , then told the server we did n't want them .
0 at least the place was quiet -- there were empty tables everywhere .
0 and the quality of them are bad .
0 unfortunately every time i wish i was somewhere else .
0 the hot and sour soup was ok.
0 this is an average chinese buffet .
0 and it all is so bad .
0 the chicken in the chicken and broccoli was so small and it looked disgusting .
0 the sweet and sour chicken looked like drops of hard , fried batter .
0 came back an hour later only to see my car in the same spot .
0 they said it would take another two hours to start work .
0 i came in with a flat .
0 so no , no thank you .
0 they fixed the flat no problem for $ _num_ .
0 guess that cracking was n't so bad after all .
0 you should always have your car washed , specially in the winter .
0 i was quoted $ _num_ for them to get it off .
0 but after what happened i will never be back .
0 they just cost me money and lost my tires .
0 put the tires in my basement , no problem .
0 they call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong size .
0 because you could n't fit me in within a day i get screwed ?
0 every single time i go through the drive-thru i do n't get a straw .
0 i do n't know how this keeps happening .
0 i do n't think i 've ever encountered such a miserable bunch of people .
0 too bad after all these prior good reviews .
0 extremely rude and condescending over the phone .
0 unfortunately , i hung up feeling like a major inconvenience .
0 the sad part about this is they really try .
0 do n't expect great performances here , expect a talked up mediocre performance .
0 this apple is too green to eat much less pay for .
0 my pumpkin pastry with carmel topping was alright .
0 i also tried the key lime cake and sour cream and apple cake .
0 while i 've been to better bakeries , i will definitely be back .
0 if that does n't work , then they try to scare you w/ it .
0 or the fact that you 'll save sooooo much money by being a member .
0 granted , it was a friday morning , but still .
0 and nobody smiled at anyone else .
0 as i said above : it 's worse than the bureau of motor vehicles .
0 it 's been a tremendous ordeal to get it fixed .
0 another employee tried to help me fix it and screwed that up too .
0 i do n't quite trust anybody else to help me properly .
0 there is no option for zero stars so i was forced to give one .
0 _num_ weeks later , no title ?
0 for some odd reason , local aaa offices dont post their phone number online ?
0 naturally , i get an automatic voicemail .
0 and again naturally , no return phone call .
0 cant wait until aaa calls me to renew my membership .
0 if i could give negative stars i would .
0 i should know , i 've dealt with at least a dozen .
0 times , and it still is not resolved .
0 why did you return there if you were so unhappy , you might ask .
0 if you are in the aaa , you 'll know i 'm calling .
0 if i could give negative stars i would .
0 i should know , i 've dealt with at least a dozen .
0 times , and it still is not resolved .
0 why did you return there if you were so unhappy , you might ask .
0 if you are in the aaa , you 'll know i 'm calling .
0 slow , rude , unhelpful , and completely clueless .
0 my soul purpose to coming here was to get my license picture taken .
0 complete waste of life .
0 going through aaa is a bit worse than your average dmv .
0 the guy who processed our registration was patronizing and slow .
0 he also made a mistake that required fixing after the fact .
0 i called aaa and the service and follow-up were both appalling !
0 so the air in tire was wasted time .
0 no one has gotten back to me yet .
0 bad facility , even without a trash can in the room .
0 i never seen such a rude person in this county so far .
0 seems like she do n't wanted to take care of the customers .
0 place was a little bit of a disaster .
0 its easy to be dissatisfied and rant about a customer services organization .
0 so i drove _num_ hours there on a weekend to renew .
0 having a _num_ hour drive wasted didnt make it any better as well .
0 sad to say the other reviews i read of this place are accurate .
0 there were zero other people here aside from my friend and i .
0 fish out of water here when it comes to hardware related things .
0 i feel bad for the lady that works the paint counter .
0 i 'm certain they notice , they just do n't care .
0 i came away with none of it .
0 the staff i dealt with could not have cared less about helping me .
0 very disappointing to me .
0 the customer service at this location is terrible .
0 overall , shopping there is a poor experience .
0 fairly mediocre , even by the relatively modest standards of home depot .
0 tried using the online order store pickup with the hopes of increased efficiency .
0 i really like this shop .
0 all the sales associates are extremely useful and educated .
0 the employees are nice but i get the sense it 's managed terribly .
0 it is difficult to get in and out of their lot as well .
0 they hired people that had to be required to do certain areas correctly .
0 i will never go there again , and i recommend you do n't either .
0 they do not take pride in their work .
0 they also lose things , more than once .
0 do not take your clothes there because they will damage or lose them .
0 as promised , they were ready monday after 5pm .
0 additionally , they did not smell so well .
0 the worst $ _num_ i 've ever spent .
0 avoid at all costs !
0 they 've ruined my clothes on _num_ separate occasions !
0 i want you to know i 'm not just an `` angry customer '' .
0 very rude and condescending .
0 but we did n't have that problem until we left their lot !
0 and then there was another lady that was complaining about their service too .
0 do not take your car to midas !
0 they place no value on customer satisfaction .
0 furthermore i week later i found my car 's belt system was broken .
0 i made an appt online for 6pm the following day .
0 he said no because we didnt discuss it .
0 seriously how to you mess up a simple oil change appt in multiple ways .
0 - the usual crap they sell to people because they think they are idiots .
0 refused all of those .
0 seriously just do n't do it .
0 had a _num_ am appointment and was told it would be a hour wait .
0 the front desk clerk said that it should not be much longer .
0 slow service and response .
0 linda is a quite arrogant woman with bad attitude .
0 provolone sticks arrived undercooked , cheese was fully solid , they tasted okay .
0 worst pizza i 've had in pittsburgh .
0 i felt sick before i got halfway through it .
0 that reminds me - the slices are huge , and are $ _num_ .
0 sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated .
0 i also should have known that i should n't have cheated on my diet .
0 not sure what on the salad made me feel this way .
0 but i 'm not liking the effect i 'm getting right now .
0 i got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone .
0 to say the least , i was disappointed in my soup .
0 but their pizza was remarkably terrible .
0 i pay my $ _num_ and wait .
0 i could n't stand to eat more than half .
0 went home , made some eggs , and guess what ?
0 the terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago ?
0 i 'm not making this up .
0 the crust was all gummy and the cheese tasted like plastic .
0 gross , gross , gross .
0 the crust was hard and flavorless .
0 this was a mistake .
0 avoid this place at all costs .
0 how utterly disgusted i was with it .
0 i spent days on the toilet after eating the pizza .
0 my appointment was at 8:30 am , i was on time .
0 i sat in the waiting room until _num_ am .
0 i waited _num_ mins in the lobby .
0 now i am forced to put in another quarter to finish my load .
0 and at least i put my cart back .
0 now it 's just more expensive .
0 worst parking lot in pittsburgh .
0 try $ _num_ , for real .
0 waste of time and money overall .
0 parking at this particular store is a nightmare .
0 you treat the employees like dogs - like one level above dirt .
0 oh whole foods , you are so so very overpriced .
0 but i just can not bring myself to do my normal grocery shopping here .
0 you may even get a nasty look , yikes !
0 okay , i 'm going to a negative place right now ... .
0 even though i was only there one time , first impressions are a bitch !
0 the food : plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying .
0 all i got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless .
0 i 'll stick with trader joe 's for my alternative market , thank you !
0 it really does n't hit you , until it ... hits you .
0 it 's why they have parking lots in the first place .
0 i 'll be honest , i just do n't get it .
0 i spent a lot , but i was ok with the occasional splurge .
0 i made the mistake of going -- once -- on a weekend .
0 maybe i 'm just not the kind of person that likes whole foods .
0 if i could give them zero stars , i would .
0 then told me it probably did n't start because it was sitting so long .
0 yeah , that sounds like `` nothing 's wrong '' .
0 do not bring your car here .
0 i spoke with brian at the desk who was very polite and professional .
0 sunday went by then monday went by .

0 i had to pay them to waste my time and do nothing !
0 this was not in the lease .
0 _num_ ) they did not return my $ _num_ security deposit .
0 they never reached out to me , not once !

0 i 've basically been told i 'm not getting my security deposit back .
0 that 's not a life i 'm comfortable with .
0 wish me luck guys .
0 ridiculous policies and move out fees .
0 please take all of these negative reviews seriously because they are valid .
0 they do everything they can to charge you extra fees .
0 the management is horrible and never understanding .
0 hot & sour soup was highly americanized , not very hot or very sour .
0 did they use the tea pot as an ash tray ?
0 cigarettes are not a replacement for tea bags !
0 the current tenant informed me that the roof leaked .
0 we just turned around and walked out at that point .
0 i would give him a _num_ start rating .
0 have you seen the terrible bathroom wallpaper borders ?
0 the wine list did not include descriptions .
0 the waitress was very curt and disrespectful .
0 overall , i just was n't very impressed with the food .
0 there was no information about this .
0 food is mediocre at best !
0 they even screwed my order .
0 asked for risotto and got some pasta , not sure what .
0 would not recommend to anyone .
0 they have to have paid their way into magazines rating them highly !
0 i do n't get it .
0 i am upset to report that this tasted rather bland .
0 i am sad to report that this too was tasteless .
0 the ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish .
0 more frustrating than conversations with the wall .
0 total waste of $ _num_ bucks .
0 also , their bar seating sucks .
0 i ca n't believe all the high reviews .
0 the food tasted terrible .
0 if you like casbah more power to you but for me never again .

0 the new tuna tartare appetizer was the highlight of our night .
0 we were disappointed with our entrees .
0 my roasted duck breast with spinach and gnocchi was not hot .
0 not a good vegan experience .
0 i again had offended by my request .
0 overpriced , salty and overrated !
0 it was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable .
0 the pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok .
0 the manager on duty came out to apologize , which i did appreciate .
0 i do n't think that casbah is my favorite anymore .
0 we were willing to try again , so we went for dinner tonight .
0 i sent that back , and ordered the sea bass .
0 needless to say , i will never return to this restaurant .
0 - ambiance is nice , upscale , not too loud .
0 only complaint was that the cheeses were served too cold to fully appreciate them .
0 - mushroom pasta : again quite rich and salty .
0 that was n't to be .
0 i 'm so disappointed .
0 i would hate to lose this place !
0 wait time : we had a reservation , so we were seated right away .
0 not worth the price .
0 main dish : long island duck - too salty .
0 it is dark , so do n't expect to take any good photos .
0 i wish i could give it more stars , but really it was disappointing .
0 the service was also extremely slow .
0 _num_ minutes to get our bread and _num_ to get our appetizers .
0 wrong it was smaller portions at a higher price .
0 i never felt so ripped off .
0 $ _num_ for one meatball and three bites of pasta .
0 - this really was the standout .
0 so , i had been wanting to try this place for some time .
0 anyway , i 'm never going back here .
0 sub par at best , go to any of the other big burrito restaurants .
0 this is the worst fucking experience i 've ever had at a wine room .
0 i am standing waiting for our table _num_ minutes past our time .
0 i tried the gyro wrap which was also a big disappointment .
0 thank god there were bottles of hot sauce and salt on the table .
0 the burger and `` spicy '' cajun soup were very mediocre .
0 i 'm a vegetarian and have lived behind the restaurant for over _num_ years .
0 every time i have ever gone , the service is awful .
0 i really , really wanted to like this restaurant .
0 i 'm not really a messy eater , but come on !
0 maybe part of the problem was expectations ?
0 learn from my mistake .
0 it 's never too loud or aggressive .
0 the food is inconsistent , but often good .
0 their food , service , and hours are inconsistent .
0 owners , please stick to your business hours .
0 it 's not like you 're open that late to begin with !
0 ... my vote is to just stick with the hours you created .
0 yes , my food was tasty ( _num_ on a scale of 1-10 ) .
0 however , from the get go , our host was absolutely terrible .
0 he did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward .
0 to be fair , our assigned server was very nice .
0 but of course , our food came and mine was cold .
0 it just was n't anything special .
0 needless to say , i will not be coming back to this place .
0 it tasted like nothing .
0 anything will taste better drenched in gravy .
0 on top of all this service was n't the greatest .
0 also they do n't really wash their cups .
0 it made me not want to drink my water even though i was thirsty .
0 good idea , but poorly executed food .
0 for a vegetarian place , there was nothing green on our plates .
0 worst tofu scramble ever .
0 days old , cold , hard , inedible .
0 sent it back and had no time to wait for another dish .
0 i 've found the service here to be pretty terrible .
0 sorry storm , you need to improve this .
0 if both of those conditions are n't true , then go anywhere else .
0 i 'm still not convinced that this is a vegetarian restaurant .
0 yep , that description of their `` chorizo '' comes directly off their menu .
0 but do n't expect that feeling here .
0 two stars because i really like the drinks here .
0 this place is a train wreck .
0 the food is bland .
0 the service was pretty bad .
0 i think pittsburgh deserves better .
0 there are too many decent pizza delivery places around to settle for this .
0 personally , i was n't having an orgasm over my mediocre pizza .
0 if not , stay away .
0 do n't waste your money !
0 i was pretty disappointed with this place .
0 the fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless .
0 overall , i would n't go back .
0 i was a bit disappointed with the pizza i got .
0 i 'm not watching my weight -- i can handle it .
0 probably not ordering from here again .
0 pizza is pretty bland and there is nothing remarkable about it .
0 the pizza was n't bad , but it was n't great either .
0 given the relative quick delivery , it was on the cold side upon arrival .
0 also , i had ordered a fried pickle appetizer .
0 here 's the catch ... there was no sauce !
0 they literally just threw the wings in the fryer and delivered it to us .
0 we tried bbq , garlic parmesan and spicy .
0 but this gives me the chance to tell you how terrible the cannoli was .
0 the outer shell was soggy and the filling made me gag a little .
0 the wings were the most mediocre wings i have ever tasted .
0 final verdict : most mediocre wings in town !
0 could not understand what the foreign cashier was saying , made placing near impossible .
0 they do n't speak english and they do n't understand english .
0 and they are rude .
0 also the driver forgot to bring my drinks .
0 the vet met with us for a very short amount of time .
0 she seemed tired , and overworked .
0 all in all , this was a negative experience .
0 imho that 's ridiculous .
0 i will not recommended anyone to ever come here .
0 i was forced to locate another vet when i adopted a new kitten .
0 being treated extremely rudely by reception was the final straw .
0 thanks , but no thanks .
0 however , i recently missed an appointment .
0 it is unfortunate that they have such a rude office manager .
0 this is not a place that a neighborhood should support .
0 ugh , my coworker spread open the spinach leaf .
0 the store seems to be a kind of a ripoff .
0 there was some improvement for awhile , but it has gotten worse .
0 they 're actually worse than some large corporate stores in these areas .
0 just got off the phone with a lady from construction junction .
0 normally , i have had the best experiences there .
0 my husband can not go back to construction junction today .
0 i am able to help move , i just could n't do it alone .
0 not anything like the pieces on the floor .
0 just thought you should know .
0 worst customer service i 've seen in a while .
0 + _num_ star because they are finally installing air conditioning .
0 - the fees are unreasonable for the customer experience we get here .
0 worst climbing gym i have ever been to .
0 customer service was a joke .
0 first of all , the gym in pretty cheap .
0 even a small crack with a few problems set on it .
0 the staff was n't very helpful .
0 it 's poor form .
0 they are n't rated properly , just easy , medium , or hard .
0 i would n't go there again .
0 they told me that they charge _num_ dollars a hour .
0 the filet was decent but not $ _num_ worth of decent .
0 it was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories .
0 apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town .
0 i imagine less than _num_ % of expensive restaurants today are cash only .
0 the lamb burger was also overcooked .
0 very pricey food , cash only , average food .
0 these people could not care less .
0 rude , unprofessional , and lazy .
0 the lady i spoke to was rude and unprofessional .
0 so when i got back to the office , i went online and checked .
0 nope , it said $ _num_ for a master stylist women 's haircut .
0 did n't she have my slip with the card number ?
0 it was n't the cut .
0 _num_ years i had this deal going on .
0 needless to say i have n't been back but would recommend in a jam .
0 sadly , the professionalism of the front desk never got better .
0 i was going to have so much done , too !
0 i 'll spend my money elsewhere !
0 i waited _num_ minutes and finally walked out .
0 receptionists were beyond awful .
0 i booked _num_ style appointments in advance for a wedding .
0 i waited _num_ minutes while being ignored by the receptionists .
0 i 'm not paying $ _num_ to get rushed service .
0 more unbelievable , i waited _num_ minutes to pay for the two services .
0 no wonder they need coupons for customers .
0 i did n't stay to find out how the haircut would have gone .
0 he also went on to give me the fastest haircut i 've ever had .
0 i will never return , to make any other purchases .
0 big waste of time and gas .
0 they do not have ice cream , only soft serve .
0 wow are their servers just lazy or dumb ?
0 this place is n't very good .
0 wo n't be going back .
0 i do n't understand the big hype over this place .
0 i 'm also not a fan of soft served ice cream .
0 a good family dollar this is not !
0 and they smoke around the food .
0 water glasses stayed empty for almost _num_ minutes !
0 ordered _num_ dishes , all pretty average .
0 i wo n't be back .
0 service is incredibly slow .
0 not worth it at all .
0 once seated , i practically had to beg for a wine list .
0 the cab was taking forever , so we called a different company .
0 as my boyfriend was talking with the cab company , a waitress walked by .
0 despite how great the food was , i wo n't be returning .
0 i had a horrible experience .
0 at that time , i even had a terrible interaction with the owner .
0 this time , overpriced food and bad service .
0 this is a bad neighborhood .
0 i am not interested in ever going back !
0 not happy about the new staff .
0 the main reason for the low rating was the service .
0 that was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us .
0 sounds weird , but i never felt so rushed in a _num_ hour dinner .
0 i also did not like that we were seated at a high top table .
0 the biggest disappointment was the veal chop .
0 the disappointment was it was over-cooked .
0 not a spot of pink to be found .
0 just clear me out and get on with the next one .
0 i made reservation and still the table was not ready .
0 i am definitely not going to the place again .
0 everything else was yucky .
0 i would not recommend working with dollar bank for a home mortgage .
0 my new goal is to deter anybody i know away from dollar bank .
0 i was totally underwhelmed .
0 this place does n't feel clean or inviting .
0 the decor was junkie and old and cluttered .
0 but sadly , i do n't see you at all in my future .
0 i got a fill and a fix because i broke a nail .
0 i was very uncomfortable the whole time i was there .
0 one of the nail techs was constantly hitting on me .
0 i will not be returning again .
0 they are n't very friendly there at all either .
0 not a bad place to get your nails done .
0 too over priced for mani and pedi .
0 but got the invoice three days before i got the estimate .
0 truly , you do n't need this kind of grief .
0 anybody that is not would be totally screwed by these people .
0 the quote was $ _num_ dollars .
0 one quote $ _num_ , another quote was $ _num_ .
0 needless to say , i will never be going here again .
0 my night was ruined thanks to this pizza hut .
0 i waited _num_ hour and _num_ minutes for my pizza to be delivered .
0 then when i got it , it was cold !
0 this is the worst chinese food i have had in a long time .
0 there were no other veggies or anything .
0 it was all mushy breading and very little chicken .
0 i ate _num_ bites and threw it away .
0 i wo n't be getting one again .
0 the pizza was bland , tasteless .
0 crust tasted like frozen pizza crust .
0 i do n't know what this sausage was other then disgusting .
0 why would they want to risk a customer not coming back .
0 these women are old middle aged miserable employees with no passion for their jobs .
0 i wo n't be back .
0 i was absolutely horrified !
0 if you have any alternative , though , i would avoid this place .
0 i am definitely not going back to complete the transaction .
0 do not go here for service on your bike .
0 maybe i just had a bad day .
0 this was the worst `` pizza '' i 've ever had .
0 this is not even worthy of the name .
0 first bite the crust was almost raw , dense , and way too chewy .
0 there was no third bite .
0 the remaining slices got tossed in the garbage .
0 this was by far the worst `` pizza '' i 've ever had .
0 if zero was an option that is what i would rate them !
0 they are the worst company to ever deal with all they want is money !
0 zero if that was an opinion .
0 this place has the worst service i have ever seen .
0 he was told that no sorry we are out of hushpuppies and pepsi .
0 it seems that this is a common experience at this restaurant .
0 recently it changed ownership and sadly the results are horrific .
0 not even a simple `` i 'm sorry . ''
0 needless to say we will never go there again .
0 and we could have been loyal customers for years to come .

0 disgusting is putting it lightly .
0 i threw the whole meal in the garbage .
0 it 's a shame , what happened ?
0 that is completely ridiculous .
0 it also does not help that they do not have beer prices listed .
0 one star for the ridiculous overcharge .
0 it was not good .
0 the hummus was okay , and our main plate seemed to be microwaved .
0 for dinner , not that great .
0 even though the groupon included menu items , they do n't have a kitchen .
0 they can keep the other groupon .
0 maybe they can use the money to buy some real food .
0 sales person treated me like i was a very inexperienced .
0 the owner is very pretentious and rude .
0 i am never going back to this place .
0 very disappointed that this is the only photo store in the city .
0 unfortunately , this is the only game in town .
0 makes me glad i live in new york city .
0 they gave me a nice receipt .
0 one week later i call , not ready .
0 the following week , they would call me back .
0 other than losing your stuff , they seem like nice guys .
0 service and products are lackluster .
0 overall , not a great choice .
0 in addition to being condescending , they hung up on me .
0 actually that is n't quite accurate .
0 neither one greeted me or asked me what i would have like to order .
0 she served the beer in a mason jar .
0 the food is n't fresh .
0 it was n't pan fried either .
0 my sides , german potato salad and braised red cabbage , were equally awful .
0 i did n't have more than a bite or two .
0 that 's total bullshit .
0 food was mediocre at best .
0 bland is the best description .
0 wo n't be back .
0 what was set in front me looked nothing like what i was used to .
0 sadly , i just did n't like it .
0 i thought it was actually not very appetizing at all .
0 what i was into was the german potato salad .
0 i was highly disappointed .
0 it was bad ... the you ca n't drink it kind of bad .
0 my husband has eaten there before and was sorely disappointed as well .
0 i really want to like this place .
0 it was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots .
0 reuben sandwich was greasy and had little meat .
0 makes you wonder just how safe the kitchen is .
0 the restaurant is located in a tired part of town .
0 for starters , the food is always served cold .
0 do n't believe me ?
0 yesterday they were undercooked , gritty , and gross .
0 in fact , all of the food is becoming gross .
0 you need a new chef , immediately .
0 if you want bland tasteless food , then stop here .
0 they need to get out of the _num_ 's with the decor .
0 beware of the ketchup .
0 then , they did n't even do anything to make it up to me .
0 not even the potato pancakes tasted good .
0 i 've had better meals at the complimentary continental buffet at the holiday inn .
0 who knows how long that sour cream had been sitting out !
0 my water glass had onion pieces in the bottom of it .
0 not a fan of this `` german '' place .
0 very low quality food for the price .

0 the service was terrible , took _num_ min to get a water .
0 we ordered the turkey reuben that tasted funky on day old potato pancakes .
0 we also ordered max 's famous reuben , nothing famous about it .
0 everything ready in _num_ seconds because it sat under a heat lamp .
0 avoid at all cost .
0 potato pancakes taste like they had vinegar in them .
0 it should n't be this way .
0 if this is personalized service , i 'd rather stay at a motel .
0 even without grumpy old man , there 's nothing special about this place .
0 everything else was sub-par .
0 the dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful .
0 the hotel is in a bad neighborhood .
0 about _num_ % more expensive .
0 why even keep this historical , old , dingy , dirty room ?
0 i was very specific when i made my reservations several months ago .
0 but , hey , i can always catch up on my sleep tomorrow night .
0 just bad service overall .
0 no one to help with bags morning or night .
0 even the day front desk person was short with us and rude .
0 i could n't wait to get out of there .
0 i would n't stay here again .
0 we never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying .
0 then refused to call m & p to talk to the manager .
0 i have terrible foot pain and can barely walk .
0 very disappointed that i can not be seen sooner .
0 do not believe he cares about his patients .
0 horrible food , horrible service .
0 the italian and mushroom steak hoagies were n't that great .
0 the steak was so chopped that it kept falling out of the bun .
0 the pizza was n't that good either .
0 $ _num_ for _num_ '' italian and $ _num_ for _num_ '' mushroom steak .
0 i will not get anything from there again .
0 it was like getting a shitty breakfast in a local sub dive bar .
0 ron 's pizza palace is cheap .
0 on multiple occasions in the past , i have ordered hoagies from ron 's .
0 the produce in their hoagies is as bad as their salads .
0 i wo n't be ordering from ron 's again , despite the inexpensive menu .
0 with ron 's , you are better off considering fast food .
0 the last _num_ hoagies i 've gotten here is again only mediocre .
0 the bread is the best part , which is really sad .
0 was going to try the buffalo pizza .
0 no longer going to try .
0 and ... i was pretty underwhelmed .
0 fortunately , i 'd gotten that info when i ordered .
0 would i have had to call in to sort out their staff 's mistake ?
0 and the food itself certainly left a lot to be desired .
0 no such luck : it came on her sandwich just like everyone else .
0 i really do n't know how this place got any good reviews .
0 i got food poisoning and was so sick .
0 needless to say i refused to pay for them .
0 the 4th time my friend dragged me there , i had a salad .
0 it sounded like she described a bad breakfast joint ... '' oh that place ?
0 at this point , i am done .
0 its just sooo unprofessional and annoying .
0 so dissapointed and will never use them again .
0 this week is the 3rd week .
0 estimated delivery time _num_ minutes actually delivery time _num_ minutes .
0 pizza hut , a pizza of last resort .
0 estimated delivery time from an online order : _num_ min .
0 do n't bother with delivery here .
0 this is the worst location .
0 two hours and i 'm still waiting on a slow sunday night .
0 food is ok but horrible delivery service .
0 they called on the wrong number despite we have given the right one .
0 small , overcrowded , unfriendly staff .
0 the food is okay - typical italian fair that could be better seasoned .
0 the shrimp and pasta , however , were cooked well .
0 the mozzarella was unremarkable , deep friend mozzarella in breading .
0 of course it was good , it is fried cheese !
0 but it was nothing special .
0 prices were inflated for a limited valentines day menu .
0 never again , they are off my list .
0 if i could give this restaurant a zero , i would .
0 do not go to this restaurant !
0 their food was mediocre at best .
0 i will not be going back .
0 went for the first and last time tonight .
0 $ _num_ corkage fee for _num_ bottle of wine .
0 the restaurant is so small and they have a problem with managing customers .
0 the food was less than average .

0 they brought mussels instead of our mozzarella sticks .
0 but this was quickly corrected .
0 but unfortunately they had already sold out of the special .
0 i give them a _num_ for presentation .
0 so i guess i did a good job at picking out the wine .
0 but did nothing to make up for it .
0 soups could have been a bit more full in the cups .
0 the worst thing about this place is also sam .
0 the only redeeming quality is the young girl who works here .
0 does not honor national sub day offer .
0 too late to back out .
0 this giant eagle maybe the worst supermarket i 've ever been to .
0 worst grocery store i 've ever been to .
0 to make it worse , they are supposed to open at _num_ .
0 one thing i like about the store is the proximity to my house .
0 it 's close to my neighborhood , hence the _num_ star .
0 but seriously , it 's like walmart stuff at whole food 's price .
0 but overall the store is way too pricy - for no good reason !
0 when i want to cook pretentious gourmet food , they have every ingredient ready .
0 my recommendation was to burn this place to the ground .
0 the produce is not very fresh and the meats never looks good .
0 the store never looks very clean .
0 however , the quality of the produce from my experience is pretty poor .
0 the lines are always long and take forever to get through .
0 furthermore , the stuff in the bakery and goodies are below par .
0 i 'd recommend stopping in another giant eagle if you can .
0 i 've had a lot of bad experiences at this store .
0 i talked to him for _num_ minutes and he was polite and friendly .
0 such a shame about this place .
0 the store itself seemed really outdated and stinky .
0 i dont even bother coming here anymore .
0 went to this store today and it was worse than usual .
0 i 'm too scared to shop there after dark .
0 if i could give this place zero stars i would .
0 i wish the north side had another option but we do n't .
0 giant eagle should be ashamed of this establishment .
0 if i was _num_ i would have beat his ass over that .
0 like who goes from _num_ 's to _num_ 's in _num_ days ?
0 owner takes no responsibility for ruining clothing .
0 they had a dj so there was a cover of $ _num_ - boo !
0 for those that know me , i 'm not the gambling kind .
0 it was n't overly crowded which made it easy to get drinks .
0 saturdays there is a cover for the dj which was $ _num_ .
0 however some folks were smoking and the bathrooms were gross .
0 my jacket took a few days to air out the smell of the smoke .
0 for some reason two drinks came out to $ _num_ .
0 however , i ca n't let this slide : your claw machine is bullshit .
0 that 's a lot of beer for less than _num_ dollars .
0 the worst customer service ever !
0 i normally do n't do this but i 'm so disappointed .
0 if you care about your natural nails , stay away from this place .
0 i do n't eat at this restaurant very often .
0 i 'm glad i do n't eat at this restaurant very often .
0 i really was n't thrilled with our meal here .

0 the pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though .
0 i hope the owner or general manager reads this .

0 waitress was ok in attitude .
0 that 's _num_ minutes to be next .
0 how hard is it to do chicken marsala with mushrooms , seriously ?
0 the penne ala vodka was sauteed canned tomatoes and no flavor .
0 the service is terrible .
0 i do n't know if they hate working there or hate serving people .
0 why be in the service business if you have a bad attitude ?
0 i have been here a couple of times and it does n't change .
0 i 've never had a staring contest with a hostess before .
0 so if you 're a horse you wo n't go thirsty .

0 ugh , i hate this place .
0 people from work drag me here to lunch more often than i would like .
0 the service is snotty and slow .
0 the food is forgettable and the menu sparse .
0 i tried the seared ahi tuna .
0 but do n't go for the menu .
0 otherwise , food and prices are not worth a stop .
0 it is n't a bad experience .
0 maybe it 's just the built in crowd .
0 crab fries , naturally .
0 was n't the best either .
0 service , small selection and mediocre food .
0 ca n't comment on any other time but this really hectic one .
0 not a degree above room temp .
0 my reuben tasted like eating a salt stick .

0 no potatoes or any other filling except a few peas .
0 service was slow for soup and a salad .
0 went to easter brunch , was served some coffee from a can .
0 i do n't understand how this place is even in business .
0 if this establishment were to be in any other city they would be closed .
0 this place is a fusion of olive garden and red lobster .
0 was n't very busy which was a plus .
0 did n't matter that our food was n't correct and our drinks were empty .
0 bathrooms were dirty and ladies room had no toilet paper or soap .
0 service is terrible and wo n't return .
0 i was really excited to hear that they had smoked salmon .
0 however , when we got there the buffet was well picked over .
0 i was mostly wrong .
0 the food was not great and not worth the price at all .
0 it came out of the kitchen with noodles instead of the potatoes .
0 but that should be explained by the waitstaff when someone orders the meal !
0 we also waited over _num_ minutes before someone even took our order .
0 going downhill ... ... man , what happened to this place ?
0 unfortunately our waiter was not up to par .
0 it is difficult to get under my skin .
0 house salads for the wife and i which were pretty standard .

0 that is $ _num_ month from august to march .
0 they probably knew we would n't have the money for a lawyer .
0 we spent $ _num_ on admission & parking for _num_ adults and _num_ kids .

0 i did n't have an issue with the place or the other patrons .
0 from the food to the prices , you could n't find better .
0 i 'm thinking we 've struck out .
0 first of all , ordering was strange .
0 wow ... we 're we disappointed .
0 the crust was super doughy and the cheese was pretty gross .
0 do n't do it !
0 the bones are small and barely have any meat on them at all .

0 my friend lives near here so i came to satisfy my deli sandwich craving .
0 it made me kind of sad .
0 o my pittsburgh pirates .
0 i warn you dear pirates -- it wo n't be pretty .
0 but was a winning season too much to ask for ?
0 you also used pay phones because you did n't have a cell phone .
0 i 'm no fair weather fan , but 20+ years of losing is enough .
0 they topped off my coolant for free and changed my oil .
0 he asked me if i had $ _num_ cash on me .
0 i ai n't going back where they treat customers like that .
0 which is pretty sad .
0 was so excited to get your pizza today .
0 very disappointed in the quality of what i got .
0 how sad is this so not happy .
0 used to be the best i 've ever had .
0 wise guys is your typical off beat pizza shop .
0 there are no frills , there are no items i would particularly recommend .
0 there are other better pizza places in the area .
0 the hostess was incredibly rude directly off of the bat .
0 it was just as lousy as the lunch .
0 unfortunately , the second visit was n't any better .
0 the place smells of smoke .
0 walking on it with shoes on disgusted me .
0 the walls have wall paper torn off throughout the place .
0 do n't get the salmon or tuna steak .
0 both tasted very fishy to me .
0 mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes .
0 do n't get them unless you are looking to eat boxed potatoes .
0 i get it , you wan na have a mom and pop shop .
0 apparently with this kind of reception , no one wants to pay full price .
0 mom and i both ordered the fish sandwich with mac n cheese .
0 overall , it was a larger than average portion for a good fish sandwich .
0 the place is dated and could use updating .
0 her first bite she made a sour face .
0 my son and i then tasted it ... understood the face after that .
0 the pasta was overcooked and the shrimp just sort of were there .
0 the breaded shrimp tasted weird too .

0 too much cheese on their pizzas , and the customer service is incredibly poor .
0 it 's a shame .
0 all it would have take n was a new pizza and wings .
0 $ _num_ a week plus gone from them .
0 she claimed they did n't deliver to his address which was _num_ mile away .
0 remember , the call was on speaker so i overheard both sides .
0 my friend was not rude , not disrespectful , just looking to order food .
0 walked off the job and all the work completed was not done properly .
0 also , alcohol in the air here too .

0 this was probably the worst gyro i have ever had .
0 ok atmosphere drinks are overpriced for the area .
0 it was so dirty i could barley contain myself .
0 the staff completely ignored it .
0 this is a gathering place for human garbage anymore .
0 check my purse , yes , but leave my purse with complete strangers ?
0 it just left a bad taste in my mouth .
0 years and years of spilled food / blood from the meat department and etc .
0 had a friend who went here .
0 the owner is the one who took my appointment .
0 they are a hot mess .
0 i came in tonight ready to buy a bike .
0 i was really disappointed .
0 the only people getting help in there tonight were two other guys .
0 what a terrible experience .
0 i 'm glad i took my money elsewhere .
0 disgusting & totally unsanitary imo .
0 i 'd go back for bottled beer , that 's about it .
0 i hate writing a less than stellar review of a business .
0 this is where i get a serious case of the sad .
0 the bartender working seemed annoyed by our presence .
0 that 's sort of disappointing but still fine .
0 the owner refuses to take care of black people .
0 not sure what people see here but it 's a never again .
0 it was busy but at times could n't find her .
0 i had an ugly haircut .
0 for $ _num_ with the owner .
0 this time around i am extremely upset .
0 karen left the color on my hair way too long .
0 the worst of it is the damage caused by being over processed .
0 i would like to say that i am only disappointed by what 's happened .
0 i very much regret ever trying this salon .
0 when i arrived , i was seated quickly and greeted by a stylist .
0 what a complete waste of time .
0 they told me it was it was because i was booking with the owner .
0 i 've had appointments with salon owners and never had to leave payment info .
0 i was not a fan and probably wo n't be back .
0 this was my second visit and alas , my last .
0 as for my ca rolls , the avocado was all brown !
0 avocado is like banana .
0 not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever .
0 needless to say , we skipped dessert .
0 our first visit deserved a _num_ but this visit was a _num_ .
0 i was not impressed with the sushi either .
0 i would not recommend this place .
0 always seem to be people going in and out .
0 the shrimp lo mein was ok but the shrimp was overcooked .
0 the moo shu pork was forgettable .
0 yeah , do n't order from here , unless it 's for dumplings .
0 everything else we had sucked .
0 shrimp and scallop with garlic was bland as hell .
0 i only took _num_ bite and did n't want anymore .
0 the wonton soup i have to say though was very good .
0 the chicken lo mein and fried rice were okay .
0 the price was fair and the delivery driver was nice .
0 i probably wo n't order here again though .
0 it 's hard to get a good chinese restaurant around pittsburgh .
0 person on the taking orders was rude when i called back with a problem .
0 this place has ok food and bad customer service .
0 a completely clueless one , that 's what kind .
0 she simply said `` ok '' and walked out of the room .
0 meaning , i never saw her full face .
0 or maybe i 'm wrong .
0 the answer , so bad !
0 it 's all cheap but that 's not reason to be terrible .
0 only once was it under par .
0 how about horrible customer service ?
0 long time customer and disappointed to say will not buy from them again .
0 absolutely horrible way to treat a customer when they were the ones in error .
0 apparently they feel that frozen cakes are acceptable for events .
0 thanks for the disappointment to me and my son !
0 this place is the worst motel i have ever stayed .
0 this was the worst hotel that i ever stayed in .
0 i was afraid to sleep in that nasty bed .
0 pretty rough , but not completely unbearable .
0 the location is n't ideal ; on the side of a busy highway .
0 the overall condition of the hotel was n't promising on first entrance .
0 the room continued to be unimpressive .
0 - no visible signs of bed bugs .
0 it 's dirty and weird .
0 the free breakfast is as bad as it gets .
0 ( old cereal and bread . )
0 i fall into the later category : i did n't like it at all .
0 the salad was ... nothing short of horrific .
0 eventually , i found bland tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce hidden far below .
0 i do n't get this place .
0 sorry , but our pizza was cold .
0 and the garlic wings did n't taste like garlic .
0 some customers may like it , me , not so much .
0 they put oil on the sandwich , but no other dressing .
0 i expected a nice tangy flavor to compliment the meat but was disappointed .
0 my date ordered a hot sausage hoagie .
0 the bread got soggy and the darn thing fell apart .
0 it looked more like tomato soup with sausage than a sandwich .
0 the dining room is also a bit cramped .
0 hungry patrons also are constantly getting up to visit the soda fountain .
0 this was just bad pizza .
0 for the money i expect that the toppings will be cooked on the pizza .
0 also the mushrooms were out of a can .
0 do not waste money here .
0 i guess a lot of people like it , and more power too them .
0 but i do n't get it .
0 way too much cheese .
0 the pizza crust tasted like pizza hut .
0 i did n't even know you could get canned green bell peppers .
0 if answer is yes , then maybe this place is for you .
0 it is definitely not for me .
0 this `` pizza '' was the worst food i have ever eaten .
0 i do n't get it .
0 cold cheese and cold pepperoni on my pizza ?
0 why does pittsburgh have to be so weird ?
0 _num_ cents per slice for every topping ?
0 a ton of cold shredded cheese thrown on top of pizza ?
0 whoever recently took over , should be ashamed .
0 worse than store freezer pizza .
0 , i would have never known .
0 had this pizza been cooked , i feel like it would be subpar .
0 i would n't take somewhere here as a pittsburgh destination though .
0 did n't live up to my expectations at all .
0 waste of time and money .
0 it does n't work .
0 man was this place packed !
0 however it just does not work for me .
0 if i could rate it zero stars i would .
0 i ca n't understand how this place stays in business .
0 i disliked the cold cheese and cold pepperoni on so so crust .
0 not comparable to the other top ten pizza joints in pittsburgh .
0 i really wanted to like this place but alas it just was n't happening .
0 they put way too much cheese on everything .
0 i know , you say , how can one possibly have too much cheese .
0 totally my own fault , but still , watch out .
0 went for lunch for hoagie , fries and _num_ cuts .
0 he employees walk by dirty tables then people sit at them .
0 my daughter and i ordered my pizza slices to eat in and hers togo .
0 after finishing mine , we inquired about our take out .
0 what they said was `` i do n't know what you 're talking about .
0 stay away unless you 're just buying tires !
0 very disappointed with this dry cleaner .
0 i do n't normally get my beer from there .
0 small dark not very opening or friendly place .
0 will not be returning .
0 the only good thing was free parking out back .
0 had n't even read the reviews beforehand .
0 it was karaoke tonight , not my fav but whatever .
0 mediocre and poorly made !
0 i would give this eat n park location zero stars if i could .
0 i did not receive water or any service for _num_ minutes .
0 do n't waste your time .
0 it 's fairly disgusting ( sticky tables , trash everywhere ) .
0 dairy queen only serves two flavors of ice cream so this is fairly unacceptable .
0 we tried to explain this and the clerk said nope , not allowed .
0 if i could give this place less than one star i would .
0 but the customer service is by far the worst i have ever experienced .
0 i would never give these people my money again .
0 this is by far not true in this store .
0 the service is rather incompetent .
0 it would have been nice to know whom .
0 ca n't understand the big secret about that one .
0 it is still in plastic and there are no burn marks .
0 i was grateful for justin since he was the most helpful to me .
0 so consider my advice if you decide to purchase here .
0 this was done _num_ years ago .
0 i ca n't believe this place has n't been reviewed .
0 nothing more , and nothing less .
0 my girlfriend and i came to have some dinner around _num_ pm .
0 sadly , this was the last time that she ever came to our table .
0 we sat and waited for more than _num_ minutes .
0 will i come back to your restaurant , i 'm not sure .
0 it went to voice mail , so i left a message .
0 support local businesses , but make sure they are deserving of your money !
0 atmosphere is awesome ... food is terrible .
0 no flavor , soggy french fries , over sauces wings .
0 _num_ minutes later my date had finished his meal and my fries were gone .
0 my breakfast burrito tasted like nothing and a our food was cold .
0 the only good thing about the experience was the warm donuts .
0 poor service , crappy food .
0 overall not the way a restaurant should be run .
0 i would give this place half a star if i could .
0 the service was the most appalling i have ever experienced .
0 do not order steak or prime rib here .
0 the prime rib , ordered rare , was medium , dry and extremely salty .
0 the rib eye was thinly cut , salty and dry .
0 the bill was $ _num_ so it is pricey .
0 i was very disappointed and would not order anything but wings here .
0 the fourth got his about _num_ minutes later and his food was terrible .
0 then , she sat _num_ small parties there .
0 this place is a bad idea all around .
0 lots of tv 's and ok atmosphere so i will squeeze out _num_ stars .
0 very disappointed in this place .
0 we are never going back .
0 this place is sad .
0 but all of the pretzel bun sandwiches are n't that great .
0 not fresh at all .
0 also did n't seem very nice .
0 very annoyed and ignorant !
0 this place is empty ... .
0 and _num_ bbq dishes .
0 not hot at all ... .
0 server kim was awesome .
0 but kitchen has a lot of problems .
0 the variety of sauces is what gets me to come back .
0 i 'm sure it would have been great !
0 the gravy ( breakfast gravy ) was warm , however everything underneath was cold .
0 i am not exaggerating in the least .
0 anything dealing with food is a train wreck .
0 i may come to have drinks , but never to eat .
0 you 've been warned !
0 if i could less than a star i would .
0 service was extremely slow to begin with .
0 go figure cooked , but cold .
0 they ended up making a new one and the wait was over _num_ minutes .
0 one minute later all of our food was delivered cold .
0 it 's also really expensive .
0 it 's not worth the money .
0 the place had a great location but otherwise it 's a waste .
0 it was a place where everybody knew my name .
0 i would always suggest it when friends asked me where to go .
0 i can not speak for others .
0 all that money spent elsewhere because of one power trip .
0 will never go back !
0 asked to refill my coffee and got a cold one .
0 average bar food , slow service , a nice selection of incredibly overpriced beers .
0 go to the original pancake house about _num_ minutes away for a better breakfast .
0 pancakes were not very good .
0 average wait time to be seated and for food to arrive .
0 very small and uncomfortable .
0 dont fall for it .
0 especially waitress was lack of enthusiasm .
0 such a waste of time .
0 i think we waited about _num_ mins , which was n't bad .
0 our waitress had n't stopped by our table in a long time .
0 no hint of a smile on her face .
0 are we really hungry or really impatient ?
0 maybe the waitress was having a bad day .
0 everybody told me i had to try and their pancakes .
0 well , the short stack they served me were lousy pancakes .
0 i do not get the hype behind this place .
0 it was just average and did n't really have any taste .
0 it came with mashed potatoes which were definitely from a package .
0 the worst part of this last visit was the service .
0 after standing there for a couple minutes we were then given our check .
0 i wo n't be back .
0 i stopped in on a whim alone and sat at the counter .
0 i did not finish my meal and got up and paid and left .
0 i am not sure if i will go back which is really a shame .
0 i ate less than half of the meal and left .
0 i would n't go back .
0 urban spoon rated _num_ % favorite .
0 this pizza is not good .
0 the hype surrounding this place will probably lead to your great disappointment .
0 i would n't order a pizza from them again .
0 now it 's just crap .
0 not a dime every again .
0 almost three days later , i had n't heard back from them .
0 my biggest issue was the attitude i received when i called .
0 so he ca n't bother with mine .
0 i would n't recommend this mechanic to anyone .
0 having curly hair , i 've had my fair share of terrible haircuts .
0 the one i had at this salon was among the worst .
0 the owner clearly has no idea how to cut curly hair .
0 it all could have been so easily avoided .
0 it does n't feel fair .
0 i am not impressed .
0 mediocre food service and atmosphere .
0 obviously that feeling is long gone .
0 clearly she had a nasty cold and should 've stayed home that day !
0 i 'm not sure what was worse food or service .
0 oily , greasy and bad taste .
0 the young waiter was ok but clearly scared of the woman .
0 the old woman was not nice .
0 that said ... for _num_ people , my lunch tab came to $ _num_ .

0 so , i will never be back .

0 food was so bad that i threw it in the trash .
0 hope no one falls sick after eating food here .

0 hope no one falls sick after eating food here .
0 also the food was bland and pretty much flavorless , very disappointing .
0 needless to say , we will never return !
0 i ordered chicken curry .
0 this place is pretty bad .
0 the food is n't fresh .
0 terrible place to eat and not very clean at all .
0 _num_ $ for a plain roast beef forget that !
0 i was desperately hungry late one night with no other options .
0 my guess is that it was that suspect sauce you put on that sandwich .
0 i ordered two chicken finger kids meals and two adult meals .
0 had to pull forward and wait another ten minutes for food .
0 when i got home they did n't give me my kids meals .
0 the place is crowded and cramped too , but not unpleasant .
0 sadly really went downhill .
0 the bloody mary was pretty awesome for what i assume is a pre-made mix .
0 i also got a grilled swordfish salad which was bland as hell !
0 iceberg lettuce , croutons , cucumbers , and dry swordfish .
0 she also split a small mushroom pizza with my dad which was above average .
0 hostess was very awkward when seating us .
0 i just feel like i 've had much better pizza elsewhere around town .
0 one of the worst steak sandwiches i 've ever eaten .
0 everything is basic with a large price tag .
0 rude , unfriendly , just a miserable male server .
0 there were _num_ of us .
0 it was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese .
0 unfortunately , the hair did not stop there .
0 luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight .
0 however , the reaction that we received was unacceptable .
0 very disappointed in our delivery order this evening .
0 the wedding soup was less than fair .
0 thee buffalo chicken sandwich had no lettuce or tomato on it .
0 the reuben and fries were soggy and greasy .
0 it was a disgrace .
0 could n't remember anything .
0 husband ordered penne chicken vodka sauce .
0 it was runny and bland .
0 would not go back .
0 the same plain pizza we order never seems to taste the same .
0 the fries were ways very soggy and cold .
0 i want so badly to like this place !
0 but the last three times the staff has been awful .
0 horrible drink ( old fashioned ) ?
0 spaghetti -- huge amount , no taste ?
0 noise level -- painful ?
0 i 've been wanting to stop in here for the longest time .
0 pizza , sandwiches , beer , what could go wrong ?
0 well , it was n't horrible but it also did n't blow me away .
0 all in all , very disappointing in our book .
0 delivery guy was shady too .
0 i did n't bother to ask if anything was organic .
0 i do n't like this place at all .
0 i do n't recommend at all .
0 no apology or explanation , just a bad attitude .
0 however once opened not so much .
0 i wish there were negative stars i could put for this place .
0 i have never been treated that way with any owner of a business .
0 as it is right now , do not patronize this business .
0 there was absolutely no excuse for his attitude .
0 got a bang trim , a low # _num_ cut , and a wash .
0 i showed the lady the picture of my desired bang .
0 she went ahead started to cut my bang after looking at it .
0 are you kidding me ?
0 and i replied , `` no , i 'm sorry .
0 it 's not what i was looking for , but thank you '' .
0 this is the worst company as far as billing & customer service are concerned .
0 when you try to cancel it takes forever and they are rude !
0 * no shopping carts .
0 salad will come first , then a couple of dogs , then fries .
0 now , their service : really lackluster .
0 the waitstaff all seems to think highly of themselves .
0 hardly saw any of that today .
0 fries are nothing special .
0 the worst part , though , is the service .
0 you practically have to beg the waitresses to pay any attention to you .
0 and i do n't even mean refilling your drink .
0 however , check the price of a beer before you buy it .
0 but not $ _num_ for _num_ standard size dog good .
0 not a good value in my book .
0 probably wo n't be back .
0 check out the better business bureau ( bbb ) .
0 are you kidding me ?
0 we were leaving to go _num_ miles away the next day for the wedding .
0 now , after picking up my dress we realized they ordered the wrong size !
0 the size that i ordered required zero alterations .
0 after calling every day for a week i was furious .
0 he barely let me talk and continuously spoke over me .
0 the downside : the alterations were very expensive and very poorly done .
0 she was sooooo rude .
0 a voice from downstairs says `` i 'm down here . ''
0 she then starts up the stairs and says `` no go upstairs . ''
0 and then she said `` no , what kind of dress . ''
0 she took me into the room of dresses and said to look around .
0 they ca n't even give you the courtesy of trying on their dresses .
0 so i had high hopes that my _num_ ( ! )
0 but getting to that point was one disaster after another .
0 then , in june , my maid of honor calls me .
0 but it was not the dress she ordered .
0 fast forward to july ( _num_ weeks before the wedding ) .
0 she said there was no time to order another dress .
0 no time to get additional fabric .
0 in the end , that bridesmaid got a partial refund for the dress .
0 this experience was not worth the beautiful dresses .
0 save yourself the headache and stay away from this establishment .
0 worst dry cleaners ever .
0 also , the staff was fairly rude and all had chips on their shoulders .
0 the owner ( larger woman ) is rude and dismissive of my questions .
0 i wo n't be coming here again .
0 turned out to be way more hassle than it was worth .
0 i left them as i was not in a rush .
0 this was during business hours that i was told to wait outside .
0 these people are totally incompetent .
0 i would n't trust them with a pair of socks .
0 do not use these people for your dry cleaning needs !
0 unfortunately zero stars is not an option .
0 there 's a reason why there are only two reviews currently for this place .
0 shame on you cathy !
0 let me start off by saying , i hate the dentist .
0 it is my worst fear .
0 and for $ _num_ that 's disappointing .
0 what i got was dry and totally tasteless .
0 the whole burger just tasted like nothing .
0 it was accompanied by some typical frozen steak fries .
0 again no salt or seasoning .
0 i met my friend jean here , she is a once a week customer .
0 i chose a veggie wrap , sans cheese with a side of apple sauce .
0 she complained the tea was weak , i never noticed .
0 so why my low score ?
0 waited _num_ minutes for drinks , _num_ minutes for good .
0 food was average , service very bad .
0 finally order and pull around , i wait another five minutes .
0 all i can really say is that she was a real ball of sunshine .
0 the drive through service here leaves something to be desired .
0 not only was my order wrong but the lady was very grumpy .
0 the service is bad and the attitude of the workers is worse .
0 i want to know what to expect , you know ?
0 they do n't use their space well .
0 it just looked really sparse .
0 this is a depressing coffee shop .
0 there 's no smoking inside , of course , but it always happened .
0 i guess that is really the only thing this place has going for it .
0 tables are often dirty .
0 dirty tables , i agree with the other reviews here .
0 no additional fans , nothing .
0 i asked for my money back .
0 you know what was the worst thing , though ?
0 then the ultimate insult : _num_ kids came in selling candy bars .
0 well , that coffee i spent $ _num_ on ?
0 that is the last money i will spend in that place .
0 does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge ?
0 i would beg the owners to put any effort into this place .
0 i asked for a pen , not a kidney .
0 yeah , i 'm not coming here anymore .
0 _num_ ) they use canned whipped cream .
0 _num_ ) my hot chocolate was just gross .
0 is it possible to give zero stars ?
0 this place has gone downhill tremendously .
0 its _num_ and they still do n't take credit and or debit cards .
0 but they use the cheapest meats they can find and you can taste it .
0 pizza was fine but nothing special .
0 the salad i ordered was wrong , though .
0 and beware of the prices : what 's on the website is wrong .
0 this store is so gross that i was almost sick !
0 i will never step foot in this place again .
0 i really do n't get giant eagle .
0 he told me i had about _num_ minutes to get it .
0 i informed him i had about _num_ minutes .
0 i left my intended purchases and walked out without buying .
0 six days and it cost _num_ dollars .
0 not even remotely convenient .
0 one of the worst wendy 's i 've ever experienced .
0 did n't get all of the items i ordered and paid for !
0 we also did n't get straws , or utensils for our food .
0 nothing special , it is kmart after all .
0 it is dirty and the employees are lazy and exceptionally slow .
0 needless to say , i will not go here again .
0 are employees required to be grumpy here ?
0 they all look like they hate their job .
0 first off , i like family restaurants and avoid chains when possible .
0 the managers do n't care .
0 then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another .
0 just go anywhere else , it ca n't be worse !
0 worst applebee 's experience i 've had .
0 we were seated and then waited _num_ minutes to even be greeted .
0 and then it was only because we flagged someone down .
0 no apologies when we were finally taken care of .
0 should have listened to my gut on this one .
0 but i did n't have a problem with that .
0 what i have a problem with is all the nasty flies in the building .
0 and while you 're eating too ... it 's so disgusting .
0 as far as the menu , i was n't impressed .
0 but i ended up with the chicken broccoli alfredo , nothing to rave about .
0 another overdone steak and utterly inattentive staff !
0 still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care .
0 i said no thanks .
0 takeout is a mess at this location .
0 very awkward location and atmosphere .
0 i keep giving them another chance and i keep getting disappointed .
0 it 's just rolls off the tongue , does n't it ?
0 i hate complaining like this .
0 but sometimes , you just have to , ya know ?
0 when she delivered their food there was not a single mention of the delay .
0 from start to finish , the entire evening was a terrible experience .
0 there are better hibachi options in the area .
0 the service can be okay or awful .
0 but she said no , we absolutely could not order ice cream separately .
0 we love japanese steak houses and this was our least favorite meal in pittsburgh .
0 the salad dressing was tasteless , the jumbo shrimp was under cooked and chewy .
0 it tasted more steamed than hot grilled .
0 the shrimp sauce was very thick and not that flavorful .
0 this is by the far the worst hibachi restaurant i have eaten at .
0 not only was the food bad but the service was terrible .
0 this is the worst hibachi i have ever had .
0 my boyfriend ordered tofu and it was cold in the middle .
0 i replied `` no , you never served me any . ''
0 by the time they were cooked , everyone was finished eating .
0 that does n't say too much for the rest of them .
0 i do n't know how people keep coming here .
0 there is way better hibachi in pittsburgh , for a lot less money .
0 benihana is not worth your time or money .
0 by now its nearly _num_ o'clock .
0 by this point we 've been waiting for _num_ minutes .
0 this is totally unacceptable .
0 the hostess that had little to nothing to say prior or during our seating ?

0 loud is an understatement .
0 it took forever to get our drinks of simply water and soda .
0 what we got at long last was so disappointing .
0 there is much better mexican food and drink in the 'burgh .
0 you have no idea how badly i want to like this place .

0 even the chips and salsa are n't terribly good .
0 even the guacamole was too hot .
0 it was very noisy and i do not recommend for kids .
0 the chicken fajita was over cooked , dry , and charred .
0 everything was overpriced ; drinks , entrees , and dessert .

0 the food was okay , but worst service ever .

0 i soon left and went over to olive garden for lunch .
0 dead malls are sad , for some reason .
0 walking through this mall just creepy though .
0 truly the worst mall in america .
0 going here is like being in a time machine though .
0 man , the rent has to be so cheap !
0 honestly i do n't consider this place a mall .
0 stay away , there 's nothing here to see .
0 this mall is dead !
0 the mall that is nearby is not really a mall .
0 even the atm was boarded up , which is really not a good sign .
0 there are also not many place to eat around the hotel .
0 i hate olive garden .
0 you wo n't find me at an olive garden back in new jersey !

0 within twenty minutes i started to have symptoms and was sick for two days .
0 avoid at all costs !
0 thats as american as fortune cookies .
0 after pasta , comes the protein , that includes meatballs , then finally salad .
0 i just passed six tables empty and clean .
0 their salads and breadsticks are the only real reason to go there anymore ... !
0 well it is a sunday night and the crowd is not here .
0 very unprofessional staff so far .
0 her ex must have ran , not walked away from her .
0 rooms were clean and the amenities were fine .
0 my problem is that the hotel double charged me for my stay .

0 add on : the wifi is awful .
0 no manager on duty for the busy morning rush .
0 they are not concerned with quality of courtesy services ie shuttle and breakfast .

0 the hallway looks a wreck !
0 the tv was definitely a _num_ 's model .
0 there are no hotel signs ; _num_ ) .
0 there were no parked cars visible from the road ; and _num_ ) .
0 it looked like one of those service elevators that the public never sees .
0 this was by far the worst hotel experience i 've ever had .
0 the lights were broken and the room was filthy .
0 do not stay here .
0 wish i could give this place negative stars .
0 it begins with no signs saying where the hotel is at .
0 really wish i would have looked at yelp before booking here .
0 she could n't tear herself away from the movie to address me .
0 filthy would be a step up from the actual conditions .
0 it has n't been cleaned in months .
0 i explained to her that this has been going on for weeks .
0 yet again , not one courtesy call , nothing resolved .
0 i wish i did n't have to give even _num_ star .
0 i got home and no extra sides .
0 i called again on july 2nd as they never sent anything .
0 i would be happy to get my _num_ back .
0 mediocre food , horrible service , zero follow through .
0 my advice , avoid this place .
0 junk worse than mcdonald .
0 horrible experience again made sandwich wrong for 3rd visit .
0 store is open until 2:00 .
0 she asks employee to scale back .
0 never again will i go to this location .
0 _num_ time in the row i got my order wrong .
0 which i do n't really need .
0 today i gave them _num_ chance .
0 for real , wasting money for wrong order !
0 today both girls behind the counter were so rude and had zero personality .
0 waited for _num_ minutes for a bagel with cream cheese with no line .
0 they other employee was doing i do n't know what .
0 it should n't take _num_ minutes to get a dozen bagels .
0 horrible service and food .
0 horrible customer service and they always screw up our orders .
0 i just do n't understand why they 're so lazy .
0 it 's not hard .
0 extremely long lines , and poorly trained staff .
0 the baristas are not friendly .
0 i 'm always always always made to feel like i 'm stupid ( seriously ?
0 and they 're just rude .
0 not like the delicious aroma of fresh brewed coffee .
0 and it smells like a coffee shop should smell - like coffee .
0 it is not daily normal , ordinary dirt .
0 not sure if the manager makes th e employees clean or not !
0 would rather go to dunkin donuts next time !
0 it costs $ _num_ for a manicure and $ _num_ for a pedicure .
0 the worst mani/pedi of my life .
0 she had no clue but claims to have been doing nails for _num_ years .
0 did n't know how to remove gel polish .
0 did n't file straight or smooth .
0 did n't clean under my nails after lotion .
0 unfortunately the worst possible thing has happened .
0 unfortunately i do n't know what happened ?
0 i 'm no longer going back .
0 i know some people have off days but this was bad .
0 by far the worst shellac manicure i have ever had .
0 i went down on my lunch break for a quick mani .
0 first the woman rushed through my `` manicure . ''
0 the manicure was very quick and not at all thorough .
0 if i could give it _num_ stars i would .
0 i really should have known better to walk in here .
0 it 's the size of a closet , completely messy , and disorganized .
0 but you know how some dive bars have charm ?
0 i was thinking this place might be like that .
0 i sat down in the chair for pedicure .
0 that 's not how it 's done in philly .
0 woman takes off my toe nail polish .
0 should n't you be doing this for all of your clients ?
0 shady and terribly run nail salon .
0 surprised someone has n't been hurt yet .
0 this is the worse nail salon i have ever been to !
0 when i said something to her about it , she snapped at me .
0 she was unprofessional and downright nasty .
0 this place needs to be closed - stay away !
0 unfortunately , i did not have the great experience others did .
0 i ended up getting probably the worst haircut i 'd had in _num_ years .
0 additionally , the experience at the salon left much to be desired .
0 something that was supposed to be a treat for me turned into a headache .
0 the haircut was mediocre , but the highlights were much worse .
0 they did n't even cover up all of my roots !
0 i really was sold at one point .
0 therefore , that left junior stylists to wash and dry my hair .
0 so please , i trust you to just make me look hot . ''
0 i 'm not a hair stylist .
0 we called to make appointments together and the receptionist was rude !
0 different people wash and dry your hair .
0 what i got was about _num_ inches taken off and no layers .
0 first , i feel like they pull the prices out of thin air .
0 finally , overall the prices were way too high .
0 my husband gave me a gift certificate for this salon .
0 there were two girls at the front desk , neither could have been bothered .
0 one did n't even look up from the computer .
0 she offered me two different stylists by name with no other information .
0 that 's why i 'm looking for my cup now .
0 why did n't i have to show some email to get the free treatment ?
0 she was basically giving my asian friend a terribly difficult time .
0 my hairstylist was friendly but gave me a really bad haircut .
0 will not return to this place .
0 once again , they were not prompt .
0 please do not patronize this business .
0 i wish it was n't that difficult .
0 the salon itself also disappointed me .
0 in addition , they offered me tea , coffee , or water .
0 however it wasnt until half way through my appointment that i got it .
0 such a waste of time and rude .
0 i should have known better given that it only had one positive review .
0 i wandered in here looking for a pedicure .
0 my heels still looked as bad as they did when i walked in .
0 i would put _num_ star if it was possible !
0 it looked like a child had done it .
0 this guy is out of control its definitely something wrong with him .
0 also a heads up - only _num_ pedicure chairs in the place .
0 very limited color selection .
0 very poor quality work .
0 got a full set and the exact same thing happened _num_ days later .
0 they must use very cheap product to lower their costs .
0 pedicure 's are overpriced and they do basically nothing .
0 it was no more than _num_ minutes long .
0 do not waste your money .
0 i 've gotten my nails done quickly before though and had much better quality .
0 the staff is the most unfriendly and have a carefree attitude .
0 this is not the first time either .
0 stuck in my lease until february .
0 no , but you know that better is out there .
0 the blackened chicken wrap was boring .
0 the flavor was missing and the entire meal was just bland .
0 also , white tortillas just do not do it for me .
0 however , i can order a salad with french fries on it .
0 ca n't win 'em all , right ?
0 but , it is what it is so do not forget your key !
0 other times , it does n't seem so busy .
0 a number of the reviews here giving off the `` eh '' vibe ?
0 finally - a halfway decent tv setup , pittsburgh !
0 my boyfriend ordered a chicken stir fry and i got a cheddar burger .
0 he said the stir fry was so-so .
0 ingredients were spot on , but it was lacking any real flavor .
0 it was just so-so .
0 my food was plain and boring .
0 the place was noisy and it was pricey .
0 well , it was overpriced and the food was terrible .
0 i ordered the chicken parm pasta and got it to go to my room .
0 very bad food and overpriced .
0 i wish i could give this place no stars !
0 no tip for you my friend .
0 especially considering the french dip was so boring .
0 no redeeming qualities here .
0 it was hardly edible .
0 i did not , however get the best .
0 although i would have to say the pretzel bite appetizer was n't bad .
0 but i really do n't think there 's much you can mess up .
0 the buffalo pierogies however , was a total miss .
0 it did n't look appetizing , nor did it actually taste appetizing .
0 food was flavorless , plain .
0 do they even have tables for _num_ ?
0 _num_ minutes later ... he asked his manager and allowed us to sit there .
0 no steak knife , no mashed potatoes , no asparagus as ordered .
0 will not be back .
0 pirates , steelers , penguins etc ?
0 they do not have 1/2 price apps !
0 somewhat slow service and somewhat overpriced .
0 $ _num_ burgers , $ _num_ domestic bottles .
0 look elsewhere there is a lot surrounding this place so you have options .
0 we waited for the server yet again after asking for drink menus .
0 absolutely nothing arrived in a timely manner .
0 and all of that was on a night where the place was mostly empty !
0 the nachos were the worst i 've ever had .
0 noisy overcrowded and not enough staff to cover the crowd so service was slow .
0 the lobster bisque was bland and cold .
0 the pork chop was so bitter and dry .
0 furthermore , it took forever just to get our waitress 's attention .
0 i would rather go get sushi than spend more money here .
0 i was disappointed the waitress did n't say anything either .
0 unfortunately , our experience was dreadful .
0 our food tasted frozen and overcooked .
0 what has not changed is the extremely poor service .
0 our meal basically met our admittedly low expectations .
0 all working hard , but covering too many tables .
0 long story short , i wo n't go back .
0 she thought the potato side was just so-so .
0 hotel restaurants are just awful !
0 would n't they want you to stay and spend money on their property ?
0 nevertheless , this place in the westin hotel is no different .
0 for starters , the place is sorely outdated .
0 the decorations look like they 're straight out of an _num_ 's music video .
0 the spicy yellow tail was not spicy .
0 the salad 's ginger dressing was awful and watery .
0 but it was not happening at this place !
0 and def not as good !
0 it was hardly halfway full .
0 so she asked for a little more from the server .
0 needless to say , i will not be back .
0 do n't say i did n't warn you !
0 the portions are not worth the price .
0 the service has been poor almost every time i went .
0 the salads are small and nothing to write about .
0 came in for drinks after a conference and could not get service .
0 do n't waste your time at the fish market .
0 _num_ dollars for _num_ people .
0 it all had no taste !
0 the steak was tough and tasteless .
0 there was too much rice , and presentation was sad .
0 service was the only redeeming quality .
0 a simple `` sorry for the wait '' would have been nice .
0 unfortunately we did not .
0 the food was all bland and tasteless .
0 it was not even blackened .
0 mash potatoes were dry and tasted gritty like it came from a box .
0 do yourself a favor and avoid the original fish market .
0 a round of patron margaritas were horrible .
0 fish market needs some lessons on hospitality and diversity or new management .
0 the food was awful .
0 do not waste your money at this restaurant .
0 just all around terrible .
0 it actually hurt my eyes to look at the table it was so bright .
0 i 've been meaning to go back to the fish market for so long .
0 i finally had the chance last week and was surprisingly disappointed .
0 both were not unique in flavor or presentation .
0 i was pretty disappointed by this experience .
0 it was n't good at all .
0 it was a small roll cut into _num_ pieces ( maki ) .
0 so i know it 's an off the shelf thing .
0 basically , this was the worst roll i could imagine .
0 so all-in-all , the food was sub-par at best .
0 i 'm sure the room service would have been better .
0 to be fair there was n't anything particularly wrong with the food or service .
0 but the quality just does n't match the price .
0 first time i 've eaten here i went during lunch time .
0 not crowded but service was quite slow so i took off a star .
0 you 're probably asking why order that when at a fish market .
0 no worries probably better for me .
0 so they lost another star for over priced for the value i received .
0 the girlfriends sushi meal was a bit over priced for a lunch menu .
0 two basic rolls and miso soup for $ _num_ .
0 this would easy go for $ _num_ at other places during lunch .
0 yes , but only if it is convenient .
0 i would not go out of my way or tell friends about this place .
0 did n't eat here ... this review not about the food .
0 we immediately left and frankly its not worth going back again .
0 shame , the fish was good there .
0 crappy hostess for sure .
0 it does n't change much .
0 they get maximum money for average seafood ( or anything else ) .
0 the miso soup was barely average .
0 no greeter so we were n't sure where to go .
0 the rest was dry .
0 she however did not offer to comp the meal .
0 we sat down for lunch after checking into our hotel room .
0 the food was ok , but nothing special .
0 it 's a shame b/c better service would have made the experience decent .
0 go somewhere else for lunch , there are many better options in the area .
0 the food on the other hand - absolutely horrible .
0 so disappointed with this place !
0 the menu was pretty random and everything we tried was really average .
0 the drinks were n't anything special either .
0 never been before and went on a thursday night at 6pm before a show .
0 i 'm sure it is in the liquor license application .
0 not my scene whatsoever !
0 super bad energy in this place .
0 i did n't even say goodbye to the friend who had brought me there .
0 she knew i would hate it but just did n't want to go alone .
0 the night was not lost .
0 i am not saying that people who like this place are any particular sort .
0 thats pretty lame for a downtown bar just because they were not packed .
0 i 've been going to this bar randomly over the last _num_ years .
0 it 's definitely gone downhill .
0 there were maybe _num_ people around the bar .
0 but the attitude of this place could be better .
0 the menu was small and underwhelming .
0 the flatbread pizza most likely came out of the box .
0 obviously , if you choose to patronize this establishment , pay cash .
0 the guys here were borderline rude to me when i dropped my car off .
0 so really it was n't a terribly difficult job to be done .
0 i could have saved a lot of money and time and done it myself .
0 wo n't come again to this place ... .
0 it was boring and flavor free .
0 oh , and the grocery store wine was way over priced .
0 food was fine , wo n't go back for fear of the server .
0 while here , we sampled the blueberry mojito and the cucumber basil martini .
0 the blueberry mojito had an overpowering taste of rum .
0 however , the rum killed any blueberry or mint flavor in the drink .
0 the sole basil flavor of this drink made it unappealing .
0 ok , i 'm in !
0 well hell , what was your first guess ?
0 i ordered some turkey wrap with a fruit salad for a side .
0 i say `` some '' turkey wrap because it was really that unimpressive !
0 when it did , it looked ok .
0 it was very disappointing .
0 however , i 'm mainly rating their food and service .
0 in fact , i could n't finish it .
0 we both threw down a brew nasty , paid and left .
0 unfortunately for olive or twist , the visit would probably be our last .
0 my biggest complaint is the drink prices .
0 it 's somewhat upscale , but it 's not the ritz .
0 owner or manager was very rude when we presented our yelp deal .
0 this bar is cramped , overpriced , and the service is unbelievably slow .
0 seriously , avoid this place .
0 unfortunately , they were very disappointing .
0 her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm .
0 thankfully i just dislike tomatoes and it was n't an allergy issue .
0 there was also no pineapple chutney .
0 overall , very disappointed .
0 but the positives stop there .
0 neither one of us ate more than _num_ chips .
0 completely bitter and disgusting !
0 do n't go here for anything but the walls and music .
0 we both got martinis and the nachos and buffalo spread apps .
0 my first impression was the outdated decor .
0 the restaurant has carpet which i find off putting .
0 the food was mediocre .
0 visited with a party of _num_ last weekend for a friend 's birthday .
0 can you say awkward ?
0 we went back in the main door , clearly confused .
0 the bartender looked at us but kept pouring drinks ( rude ! )
0 we were seated , and had to wait awhile for service .
0 i was too drunk and full of pita donuts to eat my dinner .
0 the two bites of my pork belly sandwich were pretty alright though .
0 this time was not so good .
0 no problem , we were seated right away .
0 anything to acknowledge an unacceptable wait time .
0 we did n't get anything , and that was a little disappointing .
0 not a fan of the service .
0 it literally killed me to leave a tip .
0 guess the men at olive or twist only like men .
0 $ _num_ bill and it was n't good at all !
0 the customer service displayed was some of the worst i have ever seen .
0 the food was underwhelming at best .
0 no acknowledgement when we arrive .
0 asked to leave my card at the bar .
0 never came out to see how we were doing .
0 worst service i 've received in a while .
0 i would n't go if you are of flavor descent .
0 i asked the waitress ... did n't this come with the mango salsa topping ?
0 why did n't they do that in the first place .
0 maybe it 's nostalgia for the cigar but i thought he looked ridiculous .
0 there 's a reason it cost that , because it was n't very good .
0 the sauce was disappointing .
0 i would n't come here for anything .
0 we 'll feed these to our dogs when we get home .
0 avoid this tourist trap !
0 first time in pittsburgh , from chicago .
0 no one seems to know how the public transportation system works .
0 why do i need to request a stop on the `` t '' ?
0 oh , pat buses , why ca n't i quit you ?
0 why does n't the schedule know this ?
0 i was _num_ minutes early for the bus i was trying to catch .
0 i can understand a delay during rush hour , but this was not .
0 i do n't even really know where to begin with this review .
0 well , it does get one from point a to point b in pittsburgh .
0 there 's no day pass .
0 i have been riding the bus for as long as i can remember .
0 anyway port authority to sum it up , is a hot damn mess .
0 one year after they cut that route after being there over _num_ years .
0 its only been in new york and dc for years !
0 getting on and off is confusing .
0 when to pay is confusing .
0 the service is n't frequent enough .
0 the subway system only goes to one neighborhood from downtown .
0 the buses smell like urine .
0 sucks , sucks , sucks .
0 on an _num_ degree day one buses heat was on full blast .
0 not the drivers fault .
0 buses are late all the time .
0 they have the worst transportation service ever in pittsburgh .
0 they also cut back bus services and lay off all these bus drivers .
0 pittsburgh is known for their worst transportation !
0 the bus number is _num_ .
0 i wish someone had informed the port authority of this .
0 singapore had this for their buses in _num_ !
0 some drivers can be surly or just downright ignorant .
0 i waited two hours today in the freezing cold to get to work .
0 had to call off it was just to cold out !
0 considering the size of pittsburgh , the bus system here is actually pathetic .
0 so why not actually make a decent public transportation system ?
0 finally , drivers range from super friendly to scary or just rude .
0 one , quite literally , threw a guy off of the bus for me .
0 it varies bus by bus , time of day , and more .
0 * wasting over an hour of my time .
0 big league cities need big league transportation .
0 what i found most annoying was the uncomfortable seating .
0 okay , i 'm not from pittsburgh .
0 half my dish was potato .
0 there was seriously nothing remotely healthy on this menu .
0 nothing raw , nothing green , nothing fresh , not even as an ingredient .
0 _num_ fights broke out while we were there .
0 anyway - i wo n't be heading back anytime soon !
0 avis customer service says we have to wait _num_ hours .
0 thanks for starving us avis and making us sleep in our cars .
0 i rented a car with this location as the drop off point .
0 i signed all paper work and returned the keys .
0 i became very angry .
0 worst customer service at this place .
0 no grace period or understanding at all .
0 she was as useless as a tsa agent .
0 why did n't i get paid then ?
0 i 'm not from here , so maybe i do n't share the love .
0 i probably wo n't be back ever again .
0 i thought the turkey was slimy and tasted weird .
0 totally not worth it , unless you just go for the fries and drinks .
0 unfortunately , this place is pretty dirty .
0 make sure no flies land on your food .
0 unfortunately , i learned this the hard way .
0 i recently ate a _num_ oz cheeseburger at a local burger joint .
0 that was the worst meat that i have seen since junior high school .
0 we would have been much better off at burger king .
0 worst sandwich on earth .
0 oh primanti 's , you always disappoint !
0 _num_ these guys can never seem to cook their fries properly .
0 maybe we just went to the wrong primanti bros location .
0 many people told me to go here and i was totally disappointed !
0 okay on to service ... everyone seemed like they hated their job .
0 it was really , really , not good .
0 so i guess if you want an authentic pittsburgh experience then go here .
0 i do n't care to ever go back and will tell friends to avoid .
0 in philly , they 'd be out of business in a heartbeat .
0 a native sent me here , an apparent pittsburgh landmark .
0 what i got was a very dry and tasteless sandwich .
0 service was indifferent , at best .
0 my first time at primanti bros in pittsburgh , pa .
0 i was not impressed with my sandwich there .
0 i think with some mustard this might have been great .
0 after sitting there and being ignored for _num_ minutes we just left !
0 rude , arrogant , and just nasty .
0 i do n't blame it on the servers but whoever manages the place .
0 when i told people i was going to pittsburgh , everyone recommended primanti bros .
0 it was a big sandwich , but the flavour was not amazing .
0 i also ordered a bowl of chili which was too spicy for me .
0 i do n't like coleslaw .
0 you 'll get a sandwich with soggy fries and coleslaw on it .
0 the sandwich at best was mediocre .
0 apart from that , i do n't know why you 'd return .
0 2nd experience , today , equally as awful .
0 their fries are also soggy and gross .
0 the sheer size of it all was just too much too .
0 the concept is n't that ridiculous either .
0 just get fries and coleslaw and put it in your sandwich .
0 the only flavors were vinegar and pepper .
0 ( did i mention they tasted like old fryer grease ? )
0 the sandwiches were fine and were inexpensive .
0 be warned that everything here comes with french fries , even the salads .
0 they are soggy and tasteless , maybe the worst i 've ever had .
0 half the sandwich falls out while your eating .
0 ordered a grilled chicken salad , take out .
0 i only go there when dragged by coworkers .
0 lack of flavor really hurts them in my opinion .
0 it really takes over and you hardly taste the quality of the other ingredients .
0 i really do n't know what the hype is about .
0 i was quite underwhelmed with this restaurant .
0 but then two waitresses kept coming and going without even looking at me .
0 i immediately wanted to send it back but the waitress was gone again mia .
0 she just disappeared again .
0 i waited as long as i could but she never came back .
0 until then she was just missing .
0 i had to walk inside to get my check and then pay it .
0 i was really annoyed .
0 i no longer have to carry around my terrible , terrible secret .
0 to be honest this place was not that good at all .
0 the sandwiches , although unique , were not that good .
0 it was all french fries and very little meat .
0 maybe my expectations were just too high , i do n't know .
0 previous reviews have said it well : lackluster , tasteless food .
0 so , why such a low score ?
0 the service was terrible .
0 have n't you been to any restaurants , like , ever ?
0 sit back down and i 'll take your order . ''
0 utterly , totally unbelievable .
0 the chicken was like tasteless rubber .
0 i ca n't for the life of me figure out why all the hype .
0 i was warned by others that this is mainly where tourists eat .
0 but i 'm a tourist here , and wanted to try it .
0 it was a sandwich mostly of slaw and fries .
0 the thick white bread was dry and boring ; too crusty .
0 he gave me big time attitude and commented that i took it apart .
0 and that , sir , is why you got a $ _num_ tip !
0 they left off the tomato that supposedly comes with each sandwich !
0 nope , wo n't be back .
0 disappointed , big time .
0 the sandwich was soggy , bland , and just all-around not good .
0 i did n't get sick from it , so that 's a bonus .
0 go to meat & potatoes instead , and order a sandwich there .
0 tonight was my second attempt here .
0 not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff .
0 no more tries here .
0 to compare this place to the famous sandwich places is nyc is a joke .
0 if you like sandwiches with french fries piled on them , go for it .
0 but no good sandwich needs nonsense like that .
0 i was really looking forward to a huge tasty sandwich but was greatly disappointed !
0 everything was bland , nothing had seasoning , not even basic salt .
0 however , they only have two waitresses outside for about _num_ tables .
0 it took _num_ minutes to get our drink order .
0 our waitress was very rude and did n't make me feel welcomed at all .
0 it 's not fair for the customers or for the servers .
0 _num_ stars for history , _num_ for food quality and flavor .
0 in total about a 30-40 minute wait from arrival to food .
0 if you do n't have the time just go next door to the subway .
0 i stand by my decision : pass .
0 she came back _num_ minutes later , with the beers and took our order .
0 when we did finally get our food , it was ice cold .
0 i had very little meat in mine , and more coleslaw that anything else .
0 why the hell are you in such a hurry '' .
0 had such high hopes for this place on our visit to pittsburgh .
0 can i give this place zero stars ?
0 this place was trashy , dirty and probably not even up to code .
0 my first visit was to the one in south hills .
0 waited _num_ mins for _num_ sandwiches .
0 the coleslaw is gross and i 'm a fan of coleslaw .
0 this time i got the grilled chicken salad .
0 the chicken was tasteless and rubbery .
0 it , however , did n't work for me .
0 it 's not much of a cheesesteak .
0 i ca n't hold it against them though .
0 this sandwich shop lacks all of those things .
0 service good prices cheap but food very bland and pre made .
0 coleslaw was a lot better with the hot sauce i smothered on it .
0 the beer makes everything tastes better so order at least two beers before eating .
0 i 'm not a big foodie but i like my food taste better .
0 the market square location has the most horrible service i 've ever experienced .
0 will never return to any location !
0 highly disappointing philly cheesesteak !
0 first , we were disappointed by how many places were closed on a sunday .
0 the only reason i 'm giving it two stars is because of the bread .
0 i asked if she had pbr , and she replied she did n't know .
0 ok then , how about i just have a diet pop .
0 before she ran off , we ordered our meals .
0 and then just stood there waiting to write my order down .
0 it was just strange .
0 of course , the order came out quickly , and wrong .
0 getting those taken off was another huge inconvenience to our poor server .
0 my aunt picked up lunch , and left the tip .
0 outside of the bread i ca n't say it was memorable in any way .
0 basically , this place is like dr. pepper soda .
0 people are crazy about it but that thing tastes extremely ridiculous .
0 ok , i get it , your busy .
0 so , after all was said and done , my sandwich was just ok .
0 nothing to write home about .
0 sorry , i guess it 's just not my thing .
0 i do n't care for primanti brothers .
0 the sandwiches are n't bad , they just are n't great .
0 the main ingredients just seem to be lacking in quality .
0 my other issue is their restaurants are all filthy .
0 i 've been to _num_ different primanti locations and each one just seems greasy .
0 this was after waiting 20+ minutes at the register with cash in hand .
0 i do not recommend this place .
0 that being said , this place was not good .
0 firstly , the food had no flavor .
0 that has nothing to do with our party size .
0 the only seasoning available are salt , pepper , hot sauce , & ketchup .
0 neither i nor my husband understood the hype about this place .
0 we 'd probably never go back .
0 i do n't understand the hype with this place .
0 the sandwiches they serve are gross !
0 super dry and no good flavor other than the cole slaw .
0 the only thing this place has going for it is the local hype .
0 the coleslaw lacked flavor and the bun was simple white bread .
0 the fries on the sandwich added no additional flavor .
0 hate slaw but tried it with slaw anyway .
0 way too much coleslaw .
0 def split it and get ice cream for dessert somewhere else .
0 only good part was an outdoor concert going on just outside of it !
0 for both sandwiches , the bread used was extremely bland and borderline stale .
0 the veggies were about average , not fresh , but did n't taste gross .
0 essentially , the entire sandwich was inedible and i settled for five guys instead .
0 so , i got a turkey sandwich with the coleslaw and fries on it .
0 too many fries on the sandwich .
0 oh , and like _num_ slices of meat and a slice of cheese .
0 i 've been here three times and it 's been inconsistent .
0 they really overload the sandwiches with coleslaw and french fries .
0 i end up picking half of my sandwich apart .
0 it looked pretty awful like a hard , dry , high school cafeteria lunch .
0 i would n't recommend this place .
0 we ordered the `` pitt burger '' and boy was it disappointing .
0 the burger is dry and lacks flavor .
0 the bread was the worst part .
0 trust the reviews , it 's not worth the wait or the money !
0 it 's just bad .
0 the servers are polite , but extremely inattentive .
0 came here after a _num_ 1/2 drive expecting the best sandwich i ever had .
0 the sandwich sucked ; no flavor , no excitement .
0 and the beer menu was mediocre , at best .
0 on the other hand , the fried pickles were great .
0 and the wait staff were awesome .
0 also , parking was shit .
0 my advice : locals must not know shit from their asshole .
0 this place really did suck .
0 i sent it back - showed the gal my burned pastrami sandwich .
0 she has an attitude and reluctantly made me a new one in _num_ minutes .
0 for the most part they were rude and inattentive .
0 guests always mention they ca n't wait to try go here .
0 i dread it at this point .
0 for one , the service was terrible .
0 you will leave smelling like cooking oil .
0 and their beer selection sucks .
0 but the dipping sauce for the tots were on point .
0 there is very little meat on the sandwich .
0 service is n't that great either .
0 for all the hype this was very disappointing .

0 it was grilled chicken , french fries , a little cheese on chopped lettuce .
0 the bread is _num_ % of the meal .
0 my friend got an italian sub that was ok .
0 skip this place - there are other decent cheap eats downtown .
0 upon entering you are immediately greeted by pure chaos .
0 the service is horrible ... friendly but horrible .
0 i ordered two double cheeseburgers and waited over twenty minutes for them .
0 this mcdonalds is straight crap .
0 the staff does n't seem to care .
0 he make sure that all of the customers incorrect orders are made correctly .
0 they sit on tables and often just sit at your table .

0 i have been there _num_ times .
0 food ok but service ... ... horrible !
0 he got our salsa order wrong so needless to say , we left .

0 she over charged us for her very badly made drinks .
0 the food and drinks are very over priced for what it is .
0 omg what a nightmare .
0 the second time , though , was tonight , valentine 's day .
0 it was n't very crowded , so we were seated right away .
0 they were n't dressed how i would have expected them to be .
0 but , our waitress was helpful , and our food came out pretty quickly .
0 it was n't a memorable meal or experience .

0 in short , i do not believe we will be dining here again .
0 this place was terrible .
0 the seafood tasted old .

0 i wo n't be back .
0 we did n't realize most of the restaurants are closed on mondays .
0 tried thin man , closed .

0 mussels were freezing cold .
0 how can a seafood place serve terrible seafood ?

0 wo n't go back or recommend it .
0 my dad and i walked in around _num_ pm on a friday night .
0 the dining room was about half full .
0 people just seemed to be standing around this whole place for no reason .
0 why post a closing time if it is n't honored ?
0 this is an odd little cvs .
0 this was my first time trying brown bag deli too .
0 this was one of the most disgusting restaurants ive ever been in .
0 so , i decided to sit outside as i had already ordered my food .
0 then , i go to check out , my dinner was $ _num_ .
0 followed with an arrogant face !
0 the only restaurant that gave me so rude , unprofessional answer ever !
0 oh my god ... .
0 should i really tell him how much he deserved ?
0 this place was really busy when we arrived so it seemed promising .
0 overall the food was hit or miss .
0 the most disappointing were the pita and the gyro meat .
0 my companion had the salmon and said it was unremarkable .
0 all patrons walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom which was really gross .
0 even homemade wine and honey soaked cake wo n't bring me back again .
0 this place was really gross .
0 the olives were even disgusting -- how do you mess up olives ?
0 the bill was way too high .
0 if you really hate someone , you should take them to this restaurant .
0 dirty , unclean , my friend and i went to lunch here .
0 this place is below par in just about every way .
0 i asked for my check and barely ate anything .
0 do n't bother with this place !
0 i wo n't go back .
0 the hummus is a little bland .
0 my issue was the price , $ _num_ .
0 my boyfriend and i decided to split the platter , which was horrible .
0 mostly negative , but hey i was hungry and gave it a shot .
0 i declined that after reading is was mediocre at best .
0 * the owner failed to mention the pita bread was extra .
0 it tasted worse than it looked ( if that was possible ) .
0 tough cheese mostly tasteless and chewy .
0 another mistake was sitting outside when they are trying to bring people in .
0 i ordered the chicken kabob .
0 very bland and it actually tasted baked not grilled .
0 i did n't finish it .
0 the spinach pie was ok .
0 bland again and very chewy .
0 it did n't taste fresh , almost frozen at one point and microwaved .
0 the cheese pie was pretty bad .
0 i will not go again .
0 better than nothing , i suppose .
0 none of our food was good .
0 a struggling business is always sad to see .
0 but with all of the strange behavior , attempts to scam us , etc .
0 was waiting for my check about _num_ minutes .
0 i 'm not sure if this is working hard or just desperate .
0 _num_ ) the owner is pushy .
0 _num_ ) the portions are small !
0 _num_ ) the lemonade is _num_ % ice !
0 _num_ ) $ _num_ tip even though the owner is the server .
0 stay away and never look back .
0 i had spaghetti and meatballs and a caesar salad .
0 normally i hate salads in places like this .
0 the lettuce tastes old and rubbery ... not in this case .
0 find something ... anything else ... it is going to disappoint .
0 service is lacking and food is mediocre .
0 however , neither were great .
0 in fact the room we sat in had approximately _num_ open tables .
0 just my _num_ cents .
0 do n't get me wrong ... the food is not atrocious .
0 but it certainly is sub-par .
0 the service was mediocre .
0 it has gone downhill badly .
0 the last visit last night was the third strike and sw is out !
0 very poor service and food .
0 the drinks were all ice and refills were not timely .
0 this is the strip district after all with many stores for crying out loud .
0 the food was very poor .
0 my wild mushroom and chicken was not warm but tasted okay .
0 we will not be going back .
0 why anyone would willing go here to eat is beyond me .
0 anyway , i ordered the wild mushroom pasta with chicken .
0 the sauce was really disgusting .
0 thank you for your feedback regarding your visit to spaghetti warehouse .
0 your comments have been sent to our general manager , christopher beers .
0 their service is a hot mess !
0 just getting our drinks out was confusing .
0 for our dinner , we were given a salad , entree , & tiramisu .
0 it did n't taste fresh at all .
0 there was a list of _num_ or so entrees we could choose from .
0 i unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo -- worst ever .
0 i could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar .
0 the tiramisu also was gross .
0 i 've never been to one & was really excited .
0 seriously though , their food is so bad .
0 it tasted like it came out of a walmart freezer on clearance .
0 wo n't be coming back anytime soon .
0 came here later in the evening on a weekday to an empty building .
0 the food left much the be desired .
0 the service was the worst i 've ever encountered .
0 needless to say we did not return to redeem it .
0 overall , i 've got no complaints about the food .
0 but there was no one there .
0 after waiting way too long to even be acknowledged , my order was taken .
0 skip to the second time .
0 while this is happening , several waitresses come to the bar to get drinks .
0 i was a little salty with her , i 'll admit .
0 this place is dead , but they just do n't know it yet .
0 a couple tables taken , but no sign of staff in the bar .
0 not a table in the bar area had been cleaned in that period .
0 and the restaurant is empty !
0 maybe _num_ % full !
0 they made us wait simply because they ca n't staff correctly .
0 no wonder it is _num_ % empty but still makes people wait .
0 as my review makes clear , i ca n't compare the food .
0 and i am certainly not a fan of the olive garden .
0 you ca n't screw up pasta -- it would be very hard .
0 our waiter ( vincent ) had _num_ tables .
0 i gave him my drink order and then he asked for our dinner order .
0 why would you not just get our drinks ?
0 true , this is n't capital grill , nor was i expecting 5-star service .
0 i did n't even know what fine dining was until college .
0 the worst service ever .
0 it was almost empty and twice we had to have someone find our waitress .
0 the food was mediocre at best .
0 total waste of money .
0 i went here after seeing a musical and it was terrible .
0 my sister sent hers back because it was cold .
0 the place is old and outdated , and the restrooms were horrible .
0 save your money and make spaghetti at home !
0 they are understaffed , incompetent , and slow .
0 it was like getting waited on by 1st job people .
0 it 's tacky too hot .
0 they play pop music and it 's supposed to be an italian place .
0 very very slow service and no authenticity in the meals .
0 im from california and was excited to experience this restaurant .
0 unfortunately what i got tasted like a canned sauce with minced onions .
0 as much as i hate olive garden ... i would preferred that .
0 ca n't give this place anything lower than _num_ star .
0 all our food was the thrown together in the same pan .
0 not worth the $ _num_ .
0 we talked to the manager i 'm assuming which did n't really care .
0 said hopefully we come back because service is n't usually this bad .
0 we hopped this was a one off and not typical .
0 avoid this place at all costs !
0 nothing i had tasted good .
0 did n't seem handmade or anything like that .
0 service was incredibly slow .
0 i probably would n't go back .
0 the wedding soup was the worst i have ever had .
0 the meat balls had absolute no taste , kind of like cardboard .
0 the spaghetti tasted no different than boxed pasta .
0 our garlic bread came out literally black .
0 i ca n't even believe somebody would serve that .
0 we will not be back .
0 every dish had several things wrong with it .
0 even the bread was stale .
0 mushy spaghetti drenched in the worst sauce i ever had .
0 i wish it were possible to give this place _num_ stars .
0 the pasta is consistently overcooked .
0 the service is not only poor , but the staff are rude .
0 i will not visit this restaurant again .
0 i 'm not italian , but i cook way better than this myself .
0 there was a little bit of a wait which is expected on saturday night .
0 my son 's macaroni and cheese was salty and cold .
0 this place is a disaster .
0 the service is really spotty too .
0 pros : never a dull moment .
0 the whole experience can be both amusing and depressing at the same time .
0 dont like too soft pasta , al dente preferred .
0 i was not impressed at all .
0 he seemed to be in a bad mood and made us feel uncomfortable .
0 however , food wise , it was just ok and a bit disappointing .
0 i of course had filet , and i was just so underwhelmed with it .
0 the flavor was meh and the black truffle butter was surprisingly boring .
0 they are taken over by a very large mega restaurant chain corporation .
0 gone is the famous gm bill .
0 changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks .
0 the meat was n't special .
0 the deserts were ok but the creme brulee was bland in the extreme .
0 service was ok but occasionally inattentive .
0 my biggest gripe , though , would be the overcooked scallops .
0 wow , not so much .
0 the food was bland .
0 nothing to write home about .
0 i dined at morton 's last night jan _num_ , _num_ .
0 the food was not good .
0 i feel i paid $ _num_ for a $ _num_ meal .
0 service was great but it sure was n't morton 's quality ?
0 what the hell is going on people ?
0 omg , the cheese cake ( at $ _num_ ) was very dry .
0 $ _num_ is not working for me .
0 his side of mac and cheese was laughable .
0 i 'd have to say i was pretty disappointed with my overall experience .
0 the sides left much to be desired .
0 i ordered steamed broccoli and he ordered mashed potatoes .
0 we had to send the potatoes back because they were cold .
0 do n't believe i will be returning here unless it 's free !
0 terrible value but the steaks were good .
0 $ _num_ caesar salad with tasteless dressing that probably came out of a bottle .
0 $ _num_ side dishes .
0 probably the worst value around .
0 we had dinner tonight and were so disappointed .
0 the food was bland at best .
0 the only thing that was efficient was the valet service .
0 the service is here so incredibly inconsistent .
0 the way you are treated is sub par .
0 the entire staff was rude .
0 the downtown office has ruined america 's best for me forever .
0 the customer service here is horrible .
0 i feel like everything i say is wrong .
0 very poor customer service at this location .
0 $ _num_ down the drain .
0 it was a horrible experience .
0 if only they could train their employees better .
0 there was mildew on the floors of my bathroom and bathtub .
0 the washer and dryer was old .
0 the sofa looked old and was not comfortable .
0 i did not use the comforter and one of the layers .
0 there is also a _num_ inch ?
0 they did not offer me a chance to pay for it .
0 i never used the sauna , so i can not comment on that .
0 this is rather expensive as well .
0 this is not a bad place to live .
0 the shop is n't that great anyway .
0 it was made of wood .
0 the women at the front of the line had been waiting ten minutes .
0 finally , someone wandered in from the back and rang up our items .
0 i guess all customers are n't equal .
0 the high prices and poor treatment do n't add up .
0 i put up with the rude employees and dirty store because of this .
0 here is where my mistake happened .
0 sad , very , very sad .
0 not worth your money .
0 needless to say , this completely ruined my meal .
0 it tasted like milk and no coffee .
0 i was exceptionally disappointed .
0 6am is too early for her .
0 out of _num_ reviews , i 've written only _num_ _num_ star reviews .
0 that 's _num_ % .
0 if you hate the public , you should n't work with them .
0 she never even looked at me .
0 not hearing me , she goes , `` what was that ? ''
0 was she having a bad day ?
0 i dont know , i do n't care .
0 6am is too early for her . ''
0 seriously lady , you 're not a morning person .
0 my latte was n't bad ... was n't anything special either .
0 would n't come here again .
0 will probably never go here again because the person servicing me was rude .
0 they simply did n't care .
0 worst brazilian wax i have ever gotten .
0 she also used the same stick the entire time which is not sanitary .
0 eyebrow waxing is significantly overpriced at $ _num_ .
0 do not go here for waxing !
0 sorry that i did n't feel like waiting for three other customers .
0 i will likely not give them my business again .
0 my order was $ _num_ .
0 i got nowhere until i asked that a count of the register receipts .
0 that was not acceptable to me .
0 there is a bitter taste in my mouth about lotus grocery .
0 this is not giant eagle !
0 never shop at this asian grocery since many more open .
0 owner and employee alike no manners and nasty .
0 good store - rude owners and employees .
0 not because of the food but the attitude of those cashiers .
0 staff definitely are really rude .
0 try not to come here unless it 's for emergency .
0 the food you need to be careful , because sometimes they are expired .
0 also , parking is a big problem .
0 finally on tuesday , i came out to the shop at _num_ am sharp .
0 i tried on the dress and it was super short .
0 it was about _num_ inches off the ground !
0 other than that , it needed hemmed and taken out just a touch .
0 long story short - she took the dress in ... significantly ... by mistake .
0 there were no apologies for the mistakes .
0 we sat down and jim pulled out a list of what they had discussed .
0 i arrived and was disappointed to not see the arrangement i ordered .
0 for $ _num_ plus delivery ?
0 will take my business elsewhere in the future .
0 no big deal , i would have been happy to help out .
0 i stopped in during lunch and ordered a steak burrito with guacamole to go .
0 when i received my order i immediately opened it to take a bite .
0 my biggest issue was the utter lack of any taste .
0 that 's right , my burrito had no flavor .
0 it was all beans and guacamole .
0 food was only just ok and service was even worse .
0 i 'm so disappointed in my experience at the carnegie library !
0 _num_ $ later , i tossed it and walked out , miserable .
0 this place is not _num_ stars .
0 i 'm too annoyed right now to make any funny comments .
0 it 's ... just ... not that good .
0 it all snapped into place for me one day recently .
0 that pissed me right off .
0 second , the rolls here are sloppy .
0 the beef was not the right color and was basically bland .
0 i would n't call this place authentic korean bbq .
0 just do n't expect fantastic korean bbq .
0 nice big restaurant , just lacking in overall experience .
0 this place was mediocre at best .
0 sad thing is , i 've been here a couple times .
0 so on to the sushi , oh yeah , it 's gross too !
0 the thing is the fish does not taste fresh at all !
0 but i 'd suggest you not !
0 you can not pay me money to eat here again .
0 they can not even cook edamame , it was undercooked and cold .
0 texture and temperature of the fish scared me .
0 save yourself pain and throw your money out the window .
0 first of all , foods were n't impressive .
0 they are too pricy as well .
0 their foods are not that tasteful .
0 in addition , one server working there was really rude and had bad attitude .
0 i do n't understand why he is working there .
0 he was so rude and ruined our friday night .
0 it 's really frustrating .
0 i wo n't come back this unpleasant and pricy restaurant never again .
0 absolutely the worst sushi my husband and i have ever had .
0 you could n't pay me to go back to this place !
0 upon arrival , the place is nearly empty .
0 however , it was also past lukewarm to the point of being cool .
0 the most disappointing part is the sushi itself .
0 the food that was delivered to us was simply inedible .
0 it had a huge hair in it , all wound around the crab .
0 they actually screwed up a green salad .
0 horrible , horrible , horrible .
0 we will be calling again today to get our money back .
0 sushi is not overpriced although the rolls could be made better .
0 there are much better sushi choices available .
0 i was there on a monday , so i just tried the sushi .
0 do n't bother with the sushi , ca n't speak to the korean bbq .
0 long story short : i ordered delivery .
0 vegetable roll was good , but not exceptional .
0 fried rice was ... just not what i expected , not exceptional either .
0 still , would not recommend .
0 pricey and does n't live up to it at all .
0 was the worst i have ever had .
0 will not go back .
0 i am sorry to say that this place still stinks .
0 that should have tipped me off .
0 i ordered the spicy chicken off of the lunch menu .
0 my food was terrible .
0 avoid this place at all costs !
0 fine , i had a sushi craving and could n't care less .
0 i ordered my spicy tuna and salmon rolls , both came within _num_ minutes .
0 but for the sushi - forget it .
0 that is simply lazy .
0 this place was awful .
0 her meal was so hot she could n't eat it .
0 mine was just disappointing .
0 the only thing i found good was the plain rice .
0 i also thought it was extremely over priced .
0 great service but the sashimi was bad .
0 never been here before .
0 what reason would a restaurant serve water in a plastic cup is beyond me .
0 i had a pretty negative experience for my first trip to sushi kim .
0 korean barbecue requires either the patron or the server to cook at the table .
0 i will give sushi kim another chance because i know others rave about it .
0 the wait staff -- not too pleasant !
0 man ... really bad from start to finish .
0 service is slow and horrible .
0 sushi is not flavorful at all .
0 the rice was some of the worst i have ever had .
0 i was definitely not wowed by the sushi here .
0 not bad but i have better in the strip .
0 sadly , they just are n't .
0 could n't keep my eyes open !
0 another waste of time , wait until people my age get old .
0 i can guarantee you we will not be wasting our time in this theater .
0 avoid this crap hole at all costs .
0 the food is not that great .
0 my husband thought that the crab was bland and overcooked .
0 the menu is blah and the food is also .
0 awful service , overpriced food .
0 do n't waste your money !
0 on arrival , waitress seemed lost .
0 the wait staff is incompetent and the food is grossly overpriced with zero flavor .
0 i just paid the bill and we left and went to eat n park .
0 when we showed up , it was like i 'd never called .
0 the service here sucks .
0 it just sucks here .
0 it 's hard to beat the atmosphere of this place in the summer .
0 however , the service is seriously lacking .
0 the service has always been very slow .
0 go in summer or no point in going .
0 i 've went for _num_ years now waiting for it to become something good .
0 it 's not going to happen .
0 i ca n't begin to express my disappointment in your establishment .
0 the bartender gave my sandwich by mistake to another customer .
0 ordered , is not .
0 a little pricy for food but not too bad .
0 this is a poorly run business that could be turned into something great .
0 it was my anniversary tonight , a tuesday .
0 i was so excited to get all you can eat crab legs !
0 however , the food and service is sub par .
0 _num_ minutes later half of our party needed to leave .
0 they went home hungry and very unhappy .
0 it 's not even summer yet .
0 i stopped by here this past thursday night with three others for dinner .
0 that was definitely not the case though .
0 buffalo shrimp $ _num_ you get _num_ , barely enough to share .
0 shrimp tacos were ok just on a basic bed of slaw for $ _num_ .
0 no drafts or specials on a friday when we got there at _num_ .
0 the river view from the deck was nice , but the smokers were not .
0 rode my bike out to meet my old man .
0 but seriously , there are still restaurants that allow smoking ?
0 my husband ordered the margarita pizza & i ordered the shrimp tacos with rice .
0 hubby did n't mind his , my was terrible ... horrendous .
0 rode my bike out to meet my old man .
0 but seriously , there are still restaurants that allow smoking ?
0 service was slow and inattentive all night .
0 described as having crab , lobster and shrimp .
0 seared ahi tuna sandwich - _num_ people in our group got this .
0 fish tacos - _num_ people in our party got these .
0 long story short , we wo n't be back .
0 overpriced beer and overpriced , bad food .
0 we did n't care for the atmosphere and did n't actually eat anything .
0 in the running for one of the worst restaurants in pittsburgh .
0 looks great from the outside but everything else about it is terrible .
0 they turned no wait off and said they tried to call me .
0 peel and eat shrimp were dry and tough , not fresh .
0 ordered crab cakes , they were dry and the crab tasted old as well .
0 will not be returning .
0 probably wo n't be back .
0 i 'd give this store negative stars if there was an option .
0 no one at the counter even acknowledged my arrival .
0 it looked rather like a barber shop .
0 the staff did n't look very professional either .
0 and after her comments , i 'm so glad that i decided to leave .
0 very poor service and atmosphere .
0 at that point i would 've just taken a plain biscuit !
0 a complete lack of work ethic , it 's disgusting .
0 you do n't have to have people in the kitchen who act like that .
0 rotten food and over charging customer .
0 the crab cake sandwich is well prepared but from rotten crab .
0 a lunch over charged and wasted .
0 did n't go so well .
0 they then brought out two manicotti dinners which were fine .
0 who serves a drink without ice ?
0 we had no silverware , had to request it repeatedly .
0 our entrees , dessert and coffee all came out at different times .
0 the prime rib was fatty and cold .
0 the atmosphere is also drab and just depressing .
0 the food is pretty bad for an italian restaurant .
0 i ordered a side salad and it was all iceberg lettuce .
0 the homemade bread was very sorry ... .
0 not worth the price .
0 the decor is very plain .
0 the food was underwhelming and pricey .
0 it 's just not that good .
0 the food could have come from a buffet and been better .
0 this place is just a flat out joke .
0 had no clue what i was talking about .
0 food was overpriced and less than average .
0 she had zero personality .
0 you 're probably thinking $ _num_ or $ _num_ , right ?
0 now i really wish we would have .
0 i would have been furious if i paid $ _num_ for tasteless pasta .
0 never again will i go there .
0 the only reason i gave it a _num_ is because the steak was good .
0 otherwise , it would have been a _num_ or _num_ .
0 i 'm a guy , i 've got a short haircut .
0 nothing fancy -- short on the sides and back , an inch on top .
0 the top was n't even and was kind of a mess .
0 i wo n't be back .
0 fairly average italian food other than the meatballs .
0 too many good italian places in pittsburgh to choose here .
0 interior could use an update .
0 beer selection below average and nothing special happening with speciality drinks .
0 the food quality does n't match the place at all .
0 i had the chicken flatbread and the chicken was more like subway chicken !
0 the only good thing this restaurant has going for it , is their bar !
0 they said that each vegetable would be $ _num_ each .
0 with that said , i opted out of the calzone .
0 i ordered a steak and cheese hoagie and it arrived in a burnt bun .
0 i may try the pizza but other reviews noted it was pricy .
0 no refills , no checks on the food , nothing .
0 they do n't make whole pies and slice them up for individual slice orders .
0 the salon is so dirty we left before i let them cut me hair .
0 save your money , this place does n't deserve to be named ruth chris .
0 if this is the case then my oh my how the mighty have fallen .
0 sadly , however , they did not .
0 that does not make me chop liver .
0 however , my father and i shared the porterhouse for two .
0 for $ _num_ , i would have expected a much better piece of meat .
0 there were some pieces which could not be cut by my knife .
0 in addition , the presentation was poor .
0 i could have done better at home .
0 i 'm really torn by this review .
0 unfortunately , the worst part of my meal were the steaks .
0 next time i 'll try morton 's or capital grille .
0 but one is supposed to come here for steak .
0 extremely disappointing and appalling .
0 we were seated and our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable .
0 the corn chowder was ok but not very hot .
0 the steaks came and were both overcooked .
0 again , the food was mediocre but the staff was extremely friendly .
0 this was the only place where nothing tasted like any of them .
0 fail on all levels .
0 had to send steak back twice before i just said to hell with it .
0 plus they have the worst presentation ever !
0 they clearly used too much oil and did not let the meat rest .
0 how far we have fallen .
0 our bill was over $ _num_ .
0 tip was $ _num_ .
0 this is the `` service '' industry and you missed the mark tonight .
0 poor , slow service .
0 steak was over cooked and the plate was hot but not `` sizzling '' .
0 i said no , not yet which was probably a mistake .
0 our wine was not delivered until after our steaks arrived .
0 we will never return to a ruth 's chris steakhouse .
0 he gave them a quick polish and took $ _num_ off the price .
0 he had my money and had no more use for me .
0 this place is horrible .
0 you can get better service elsewhere for cheaper .
0 i brought my boots here to get fixed .
0 i wo n't be going here again .
0 no accessible stalls in restrooms .
0 after i ordered , the waiter came back twice .
0 once to tell me that they could n't do the veggies .
0 oh , with _num_ pitiful shrimp on top .
0 there was the powder parmesan on the table which i added myself .
0 oh , but wait until i got my bill !
0 the shrimp were $ _num_ a piece .
0 what a rip off and so much for my budget .
0 we had a big group but my bill did n't have the tip added .
0 get me out of here !
0 i get that -- but the place was empty .
0 the place is empty .
0 it was such a nightmare .
0 i did n't know hamburgers were traditional italian fare .
0 the prices here can be ridiculous .
0 i mean , empty .
0 no one else in the same dining room .
0 i took the olive oil off the table next to ours .
0 so , i 've tried this place _num_ times and that was enough .
0 not worth the attitude of the staff .
0 it was just meh .
0 the chicken was n't very well seasoned and the sauce was overpowered by lemon .
0 all i could taste was citrus .
0 i also had a few bites of the chicken marsala .
0 i was really disappointed with this visit .
0 we probably wo n't be back any time soon .
0 negatives : the lighting , the decor and the smoking .
0 glad we went , but we wo n't go back .
0 the selection here is stellar , but the prices are ridiculously high .
0 even whole foods is less expensive .
0 the service is most often rude .
0 the gelato counter was disappointing .
0 is n't that the same as `` not made fresh in pittsburgh ? ''
0 the truffles had two salted , one of which was milk chocolate .
0 they were so salty that the chocolate flavor did not come through .
0 however that is not what pittsburgh is about .
0 this is just my experience .
0 no thanks , much better candy shops around the city .
0 any way i could n't figure out what their problem was .
0 thank you for your horrible customer service i will never be back.
0 there 's nothing about this specific location that is bad .
0 inside is just average quality , equally average priced produce .
0 cheap , everyone seems to say that .
0 but i was n't feeling it here .
0 did n't even get a `` thanks '' with my change .
0 so not worth the walk that we took to get here .
0 we were greeted very warmly by one of the ice cream technicians .
0 the parlor looked nothing like the pictures on this website .
0 the technician was telling us how it was closed and had just reopened .
0 the character of the place was great but could use a little tlc .
0 the menu was very small and hard to read and understand .
0 the ice cream technician could only take one order at a time .
0 i ordered mine , chocolate , and cried vanilla .
0 she did n't listen at all .
0 i figured palace like this would have made their own strawberry topping .
0 _num_ sundaes were $ _num_ .
0 literally they kept their heads down and refused to make eye contact .
0 no breaking of the ice .
0 this place is terrible !
0 she left her other co-worker to handle the entire crowd .
0 we had the same experience when we walked in .
0 however i agree with the previous reviews that the staff are killing it .
0 just kind of awkward , but no big deal .
0 a regular ice cream cone was $ _num_ .
0 tasty , but not real butter pecan .
0 i gave her a call and she did n't pick up .
0 at this point i really had to use the restroom .
0 i waited until _num_ and knocked normally so that it would be heard .
0 i 'd give it zero stars if i could .
0 but these corporate suits refused .
0 so - they 've lost a customer - a platinum customer .
0 a little goodwill would have cost them nothing .
0 when i checked in , the front desk staff was missing .
0 when i checked out , the front desk staff was missing .
0 the pillows were appalling and there was no complimentary breakfast and no refrigerator .
0 what a disgrace to the marriott name .
0 ok , but they do not go out of their way to help !
0 finally they allowed me to put down cash .
0 literally worst service i 've ever received at a hotel .
0 do not stay here .
0 you will be disappointed .
0 the manager nowhere to be seen .
0 not personal at all strictly business .
0 the better restaurant is the little cafe across the street owned by same owner .
0 to get a cab walk to the westin across the street .
0 no hello on entering .
0 not a _num_ star .
0 really a _num_ star .
0 do n't walk away .
0 not even the shuttle goes anywhere useful .
0 linda b august _num_ will never stay again !
0 i had a bad impression of this hotel before i even entered .
0 eventually , i had to get my project manager to resolve this issue .
0 do no stay here if you plan to sleep before 2:30 am .
0 that young lady obliged with no hesitation - i was very grateful .
0 the desk ) until i 've given the room the all clear .
0 i could n't have been happier !
0 no bueno and no thank you !
0 my second room : same line , 3rd floor , also accessible .
0 shower shoes , i never leave home without them !
0 i reserved a king room and got stuck in a room with two queens .
0 i will not be staying at this location again .
0 they apologized which i appreciate , but it does n't fix anything .
0 i ca n't wait to check out .
0 her corned beef was brown and bad .
0 the real reason for the single star was the cole slaw .
0 yuck i have avoided this subway like the plague .
0 i literally walk past this subway _num_ times a week .
0 the attitude of the workers here is just pitiful .
0 my gripe here is that i ended up with scratches on my wheels .
0 waiting _num_ minutes for a cold club and cup of soup is totally unacceptable .
0 it was not crowded , but the waiter was almost useless .
0 plus i was served teriyaki fajitas .
0 overall it was just ok food served by an incompetent waiter .
0 for me the food was terrible .
0 i would n't even have cooked this way for an enemy .
0 they are in terrible shape .
0 i could n't believe it !
0 well , this place manages to be worse than it .
0 the place is rather run down .
0 the buffet was really terrible .
0 it just was n't a great environment .
0 soups were borderline offensive .
0 there probably wo n't be a wait !
0 worst chinese food in pittsburgh !
0 this is the worst chinese food i 've had .
0 and pittsburgh has some pretty bad chinese places .
0 the golden palace buffet is bad , but at least edible .
0 it was late at night near closing , only thing i could find open .
0 went to _num_ tavern for lunch a few weeks back .
0 second i was with a party of _num_ that all ordered salads .
0 the salad had way too much iceberg lettuce and tasted like crap .
0 the place was empty .
0 it 's the same thing but _num_ more dollars .
0 they did have other types of dogs but they were more expensive .
0 it was bad in every way it could be bad .
0 frozen , greasy , tasteless , heavy on bland batter and light on fish .
0 so why do they get _num_ stars instead of just _num_ ?
0 but each time i come away disappointed , even more than last time .
0 every time , the hotdogs ( and brats ) are harder than a rock .
0 wo n't be eating there again .
0 i do n't understand why this place think 's it has famous corned beef .
0 i can only believe it 's because there are no other deli 's downtown .
0 the corned beef is nothing great and their side dishes are nothing special .
0 not worth the trip .
0 i do n't think sammy has ever even had a good corned beef sandwich .
0 meat was dry under seasoned and luke warm .
0 the bread was just sliced supermarket bread .
0 rules made by men .
0 when the food finally came it was bad .
0 the prices are cheap , but it 's not worth it .
0 the food itself was not too bad .
0 my friend 's greek salad however was very tasty .
0 a place i would go back to but not regularly .
0 the food was terrible !
0 we quickly found out why .
0 i would not recommend this place for food .
0 this is a very small irish pub .
0 the bar area felt cramped and made me uncomfortable .
0 are you gon na eat that ?
0 if not , um , why would we want to pay for it ?
0 they did n't accommodate for a member of our group that had an allergy .
0 the soda was flat .
0 possible the worst restaurant i was ever in .
0 worst experience at a restaurant ever .
0 i do n't need anything fancy but this was pathetic .
0 why did n't we just leave then .
0 if i could rate this a zero , i would .
0 food was not awful , but just barely average .
0 finally got seated and waited _num_ minutes for waters and then ate mediocre food .
0 wo n't be back .
0 the steak was rough and bad .
0 i will never be back .
0 i have better food in m own .
0 definitely has the local irish bar feel to it .
0 mine was not very cold and his pour was light .
0 $ _num_ credit card minimum .
0 it really feels like a total lack of effort , honesty and professionalism .
0 this represents a real problem for the city .
0 this place was horrible .
0 the walls were dirty , nasty and dingy .
0 it smelled awful inside .
0 it was quite crowded .
0 and i just did not like my surroundings .
0 not a good way to sell the city ... horrible !
0 this continued for the total of _num_ hours .
0 there is no wifi and only two outlets .
0 it would have probably been better to take the mega bus .
0 not good at all .
0 thus station needs more amenities and a makeover to compete with the dc one !
0 the `` chicken '' is dark , fatty , and inedible .
0 do n't miss the _num_ pound tub of msg as you walk in .
0 you should skip this place for sure .
0 the place was more of a hole in the wall then i can appreciate .
0 cheap but your getting what you pay for in quality .
0 the food was gross and i usually would n't say that about a place .
0 it 's not worth it .
0 they were very quick ( food ordered and delivered in under _num_ minutes ) .
0 the noodles were very bland and almost chewy .
0 my boyfriend 's general tso 's was less than subpar .
0 the egg roll 's did n't even have shrimp in them .
0 this is by far the worst chinese food i have ever had .
0 the fried rice did n't have any vegetable in it and was so bland .
0 the egg roll wasnt even cooked and the cabbage was awful .
0 i called to complain and they hung up on me .
0 do n't waste your time , order from somewhere else .
0 worst chinese i 've had in pittsburgh .
0 i spend _num_ dollars on soggy food that lacked flavor .
0 cheap food but my chicken was burnt .
0 my co-worker 's chicken was n't cooked right .
0 not gon na order from here again .
0 we wasted $ _num_ on spoiled food .
0 do not use this dry cleaner .
0 there are ash trays and packs of cigarettes lying around .
0 they lost my clothes and charged me for stuff i never sent .
0 ehh ... it 's not all that .
0 watch the dried bulk stuff - it 's old and stale .
0 i found little bugs crawling around the seeds and nuts in my little bags .
0 bought the store 's speciality sausages - bland and tasted of spoiled meat .
0 cold cuts were good though pricey .
0 highly questionable hygiene for a food store !
0 i will not go back until they clean up the place .
0 that was not the first time .
0 i have a idea , get rid of those cashiers , fire them !
0 i will not go back until they are gone .
0 a simple yes or no would have been nice .
0 in a very rude voice .
0 needless to say i walked away .
0 obviously she hates her job , then get another one !
0 every january i buy _num_ months worth of cheese for my family members .
0 i proceeded to say , '' are you laughing at me ? ''
0 altogether , spent $ _num_ and left with a great disappointment !
0 this is the last time i try this unclean and rude establishment .
0 breeze and the cat was tested and was negative .
0 there was no internet at the time .
0 i would not bring a spider there .
0 if i could give this place _num_ starts i would .
0 it was just average , nothing special .
0 this is no mike and tony 's or big greek gyro in market square .
0 i wo n't be back .
0 the workers are not greek chefs and are very condescending .
0 the gyro sandwich for $ _num_ was ok at best .
0 they threw some tomatoes on it .
0 the fries for $ _num_ were undercooked .
0 we are talking a plain bottle with mystery ketchup .
0 they charge about $ _num_ for a drink with no free refills .
0 tables were not very clean .
0 disappointing experience after almost a year since the last time i was here .
0 ingredients were n't fresh and the gyro was heavy on the spices .
0 ordered a gyro and the meat was cold .
0 i really do n't see the hype .
0 i 've only eaten here once before .
0 i 've included this very depressing looking `` steak hoagie '' .
0 the food was terrible & the cooks need to get it together .
0 just order from one of the two sites i listed above .
0 not one employee even said hello !
0 , the service was fine , but the food was totally forgettable .
0 i remember the waiters attitude more then some of the food .
0 the menu is n't particularly veg friendly , but it 's not too bad .
0 lidia 's does high-end traditional italian without being too pretentious or too predictable .
0 i really wanted to like this place , but i really did n't .
0 long story short , we passed on dessert .
0 i wo n't go back .
0 lidia 's is an upscale olive garden with slightly better wine list .
0 they have a salt problem .
0 the lamb chops were awful .
0 lamb tasted like the grill and not at all like lamb .
0 the tomato was hard as rock .
0 just in the way it is laid out and with the choices .
0 but the worse is the pasta trio .
0 the concept is just so olive garden .
0 i just have to wonder why lidia would create a menu like this .
0 it just does n't match her books or shows at all .
0 it does nothing to support the brand of lidia .
0 unless she is really trying to take over the olive garden market .
0 their menu does n't include really any .
0 maybe those light fixtures would have tasted better than the lasagna ?
0 the service was not very good .
0 we left overall feeling disappointed in the service and the quality of the food .
0 i had a bite of a chocolate torte , and was very impressed .
0 all things told , though , i would spend my money elsewhere .
0 it was not spicy .
0 it was overcooked , like rubber , and served on plain white beans .
0 i wo n't go back .
0 most of his seafood was also overcooked and tasteless .
0 i was very disappointed with my meal here .
0 and was really disappointed .
0 too bad the food was n't good .
0 the beet salad was underwhelming .
0 my other dining companion had the osso bucco which was dry and stringy .
0 and thus my rating of meh .
0 which is a huge shame .
0 this place had horrible service .
0 we were eating here often , but it got boring quickly .
0 i watch lidia on tv and have a lot of her recipes .
0 then , i ate here .
0 are these the same people running this restaurant ?
0 do n't you care about your reputation and good name ?
0 also , the service was not that good .
0 one word ; gross .
0 this is not italian food - it 's pittsburgh italian food .
0 the wine list is lacking .
0 in short , avoid this place !
0 the main courses themselves were a disaster .
0 and the manicotti was watery and flavorless .
0 i ordered the chicken marsala ( waitress 's favorite ) and it was disgusting .
0 lidia 's was a major disappointment for me .
0 decor and service were just fine , no issues there .
0 i was disappointed in the food !
0 i get better shrimp pasta at macaroni grill !
0 i 'm not sure why people like this place so much .
0 the service was friendly but the food was very poor .
0 i would not entertain having an event for any more than _num_ people .
0 the lasagne i ordered was flavorless as well .
0 for salad , they only served `` caesar salad '' .
0 overall , let me say that the restaurant is becoming dated .
0 colors and decor seem boring and out of style .
0 the service was horrible .
0 from hostess crew to the bar to the waitress , it was bad .
0 did i mention the service was bad ?
0 the bar staff was n't concerned with us and were n't friendly at all .
0 then it took another _num_ to order .
0 then _num_ mins to get our food !
0 however , seconds never came .
0 waitress did n't even know until i told her politely .
0 however she charged the $ _num_ pasta trio ( which comes with desert ) .
0 now i had a $ _num_ salad and $ _num_ pasta trio .
0 i was expecting $ _num_ + $ _num_ salad upgrade .
0 is n't the rule `` customer is always right '' ?
0 finally , we felt like the whole restaurant clientele has declined .
0 we were so looking forward to the food but our experience was awful .
0 there was no background music .
0 the waiter was young and inexperienced .
0 would not recommend it .
0 this spot would n't have lasted a year in nyc .
0 i ate here when it opened , a and again _num_ years later .
0 for starters we were served ice cold meatballs and limp soggy salads .
0 the entrees were dull and lacked seasoning .
0 it 's tough to find anything good here .
0 the menu offerings were spotty .
0 gnocchi and duck ragu was what i ordered .
0 i was very disappointed .
0 ate at this resturant while on a business trip .
0 our food was just average , nothing special .
0 the service was absolutely horrible .
0 our waitress carrie was extremely rude and had a really bad attitude .
0 i would probably not come back .
0 lidia 's was one of our favorite italian restaurant in the city .
0 first , our waitress was not well informed of the offerings that evening .
0 she had to check with kitchen several times to answer our questions .
0 second , our food was served just barley warm .
0 third , the food was lacking in proper seasoning and without any taste .
0 i guess i expected fabulous -- but everything was just good , nothing spectacular .
0 we will not be back .
0 nothing to talk about .
0 the service was sub-par on a friday night .
0 for my entree , i tried the lasagna recommended by the waiter .
0 took my friends from out of town to lidia last night , very disappointed .
0 i could n't understand why people raving about it too much .
0 over charge and terrible food .
0 terrible will never go back .
0 calamari was not fresh .
0 pasta trio had the worst sauce i have ever tasted .
0 caesar salad was drowning in tart dressing .
0 pasta trio - _num_ out of the _num_ was passable .
0 good groupon deal but terrible food - will not be back .
0 i do n't remember it being this bad .
0 pasta trio was bizarre .
0 only passable pasta was the pear & ricotta ravioli .
0 waitress walked away two times while opening our bottle of wine .
0 it was downhill from there .
0 lamb chops and shrimp pasta were just ok.
0 ( $ _num_ + $ _num_ ) .
0 the salads came out and the plates were a little sloppy in appearance .
0 for the main course , i selected the gnocchi and grilled sausage .
0 the sausage was made in-house and was very flavorful .
0 very unappetizing and i was unable to continue eating .
0 the pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce was n't too sweet .
0 even the server commented on the lack of a sauce .
0 no meat in any of the _num_ pastas .
0 i had the pasta trio .
0 none of the pastas had any flavor .
0 the caesar salad was fine , but not inspiring .
0 the three pastas were very , very basic .
0 the only thing that saved the evening from disaster were our server and busser .
0 i think lidia & grandma would be appalled !
0 so i was appalled by a lousy not fresh dirty salad !
0 i pushed it away ugh !
0 do n't be fooled !
0 it came w duck ragu that was ice cold !
0 try their calamari over angel hair yum !
0 lidia should be embarrassed .
0 grilled octopus : where 's the octopus ?
0 waitress was nice but it 's obvious that this place is run poorly .
0 staff training is badly needed .
0 what a huge disappointment .
0 bottom line : horrid service , mediocre food .
0 no wine glasses or anything to make the table look pretty .
0 our server was nice but rushed .
0 there was absolutely no care or thought put into this salad .
0 my date 's bruschetta appetizer was bland .
0 i was presented with ... an empty plate .
0 which i really did n't since they were all mediocre with little flavor .
0 in the meantime , date was unimpressed with the chicken .
0 if possible , the service got worse after we talked to him .
0 and when the dessert came it was ice cold and solid as a rock .
0 horrible service and food was bland .
0 lidia should spend more time in her restaurants to see first hand .
0 the waiter said she only comes to town twice a year .
0 your brand is being damaged because your staff does n't seem to care .
0 most likely will not return .
0 more disappointing than the service was the food , which was really underwhelming .
0 granted , the calamari and shrimp that were there were cooked perfectly .
0 risotto , while one of my favorites , is n't pasta .
0 it has been nothing but bad service .
0 i give a _num_ rating only because of the service .
0 there are fruit flies hovering around our table too .
0 the pasta with chicken was about the best from the trio .
0 it 's an ayce trio .
0 it 's now 8:30 and still not even close to dessert .
0 i 'm sure the ending does n't get much better .
0 we were ... disappointed .
0 our main dishes were equally mediocre .
0 the wild boar ravioli tasted fine , but the presentation was seriously lacking .
0 the duck breast was under done .
0 he never approached our table , but he walked past us several times .
0 we continued to wait another _num_ minutes then decided to leave .
0 lidia should be ashamed that this is being run this way .
0 really wanted to like it here , but am never going back .
0 for a professional chef 's restaurant the `` pasta '' was mediocre .
0 fake italian at its finest .
0 unless olive garden is closed , do n't go here .
0 unfortunately yelp asked to provide more details on review .
0 the information for this restaurant needs to be updated !
0 last week my husband and i visited pittsburgh for a rock concert .
0 it was a very disappointing meal .
0 i ordered the pasta trio , and my husband ordered the risotto .
0 it was pasta , after all , one small serving of each .
0 i had dessert , which was _num_ flavors of gelato .
0 sorry to say , restaurant is riding on its former reputation .
0 the bartender does n't belong in the business .
0 rude to patron and to his own colleagues .
0 first off , it is desperately in need of some updates .
0 and service is piss poor and understaffed .
0 _num_ big screen tvs .
0 well sports rock failed on all accounts .
0 i was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual tvs on each table .
0 plus , beer was _num_ !
0 prices too high for strip district beer .
0 upstairs looks like it 's a club at night .
0 it is a white pizza with minimal ingredients except for the lamb skewers .
0 standard so-so pittsburgh pizza .
0 if they did n't , that would be fine we 'd call someplace else .
0 should be _num_ minutes '' .
0 _num_ minutes later the delivery guy calls and says he 's on his way .
0 _num_ minutes later he calls again and asks where we are .
0 when we finally got the pizza , it was not hot .
0 better luck next time .
0 after ordering from here my credit card number was stolen .
0 ordered two personal size pizzas , spicy fries , fried zucchini & onion rings .
0 tastes plain & over cooked .
0 i do n't think i 'm being harsh .
0 is sad because the pizza is great but the service is horrible !
0 delivery : horrible experience .
0 we waited over _num_ hours for the food to be delivered .
0 she promptly explained that the internet was down .
0 and , apparently , delivery .
0 it was all kind of meh to me .
0 food is terrible so is customer service .
0 there are better restaurants in pittsburgh .
0 this is piss poor excuse for a turkish restaurant .
0 this was more than _num_ hours after i had placed the order .
0 as soon as i hung up the phone , the food was delivered .
0 i did not receive the free cheesy bread and the drink order was incorrect .
0 i would be careful ordering food here .
0 the service was very poor .
0 delivery was fine but the food was terrible .
0 but it was seriously bad .
0 but i could n't eat it .
0 are you kidding me ?
0 these hoagies are the most pathetic hoagies i 've ever seen or eaten !
0 you should be embarrassed and ashamed to even be selling these !
0 we checked in , put our stuff in our room , and left .
0 later on , we realized that there was no soap anywhere in the bathroom .
0 you 're paying like $ _num_ a night for no soap .
0 about _num_ minutes later someone came with soap .
0 it was a super rude way of dealing with that situation .
0 the next morning we tried to leave and it was nearly impossible .
0 the whole experience was absolutely ridiculous .
0 but would it kill you to spend a little to upgrade your rooms ?
0 upon entering it smelled of sewage and was very dark .
0 it did seem a little unwelcoming and a little dated .
0 i was then transferred to housekeeping where i was constantly sent to a voicemail .
0 it is unfortunate because that blanket has been in the family for _num_ years .
0 i was tired , packed bags , and waiting to get to the airport .
0 i did n't hear back .
0 they said yes , and i just confirmed it had not been .
0 by far , the worst hotel staff experience i have ever had .
0 i would never stay in this hotel again .
0 the cleanliness of the bathrooms is less than desirable .
0 the pittsburgh auto show was held at the david l. convention center .
0 we lucked out and go on the shuttle over without waiting in the cold .
0 it was terrible waiting in line , but it moved quickly .
0 it was $ _num_ a piece for my wife and i to get in .
0 children _num_ and under are free .
0 $ _num_ for _num_ items is crazy !
0 domestic beers were $ _num_ .
0 i mean thats absurd to charge these prices !
0 the auto show was a disappointment .
0 it was pretty busy and there were people everywhere .
0 it was annoying fighting the crowds to look at the certain cars .
0 all in all , it was a disappointment this year .
0 we might not go every year , but maybe every other year .
0 the check-in desk was super slow during my stay there .
0 still , i think there are newer hotels that provide the same .
0 we got this hotel room via hotwire at a great price .
0 parking at the hotel is expensive .
0 my biggest complaint is that our shower was n't clean .
0 the coffee shop attached to the hotel is just ok .
0 or it had just spilled and they did n't want to waste it .
0 however , the customer service lacks excellence and the wifi is completely unreliable .
0 we have stayed in westin hotels all over the country .
0 but this place is downright disgusting .
0 no fitted sheets on the beds ?
0 the tv movies did n't work ?
0 the place is just dirty .
0 two seconds later , they come to want to clean ?
0 i would n't step foot in that hot tub ever again .
0 unless you want to catch a disease .
0 the pool is strictly a lap pool .
0 and the women 's locker room was nasty .
0 looked like it had n't been cleaned in a month .
0 the only plus was the shuttle service and driver .
0 do n't stay here , save your money .
0 however , i had the absolute worst hotel experience at the pittsburgh westin .
0 the terrible experience happened before i even arrived .
0 i ordered the turkey blt with lemon aioli and arugula salad .
0 really poor service and way overpriced .
0 the rooms are not worth the money .
0 the wi-fi was free and the tv channel selections were pretty good .
0 i would not revisit the westin convention center .
0 had to have my sheets changed when i got to my room .
0 worst elevator system i 've ever come across .
0 rude front desk staff .
0 talk about a nasty look and attitude .
0 i was sooooo disappointed with this hotel .
0 the ac barely works .
0 but maybe they 're not even trying !
0 again this is pittsburgh not philly , dc , or ny .
0 breakfast options in the immediate area are almost nonexistent .
0 the coffee maker is disgusting and smells .
0 i gave the management a heads up , and it was not fixed .
0 disappointing at every turn .
0 this hotel does not live up to the westin standards i 'm used too .
0 the hallways smell as do the rooms and they are not clean at all .
0 the beer is cheap .
0 horrible , go to long john silver 's .
0 i hear oyster bar and think delicious raw oysters not deep fried crap .
0 i should know better than to have high expectations .
0 the two jumbo fried shrimp were ok.
0 both the waitress and the bartender were extremely rude .
0 i was n't impressed with my clam chowder .
0 however , they have several cooked selections .
0 i should have known then that it would be a bad experience .
0 waitress wiped off table and pushed crumbs into my lap .
0 styrofoam plates and plastic forks .
0 it really is just a bar with bad bar food .
0 cash only is really customer friendly as well .
0 do n't understand how anyone could give this place a favorable rating .
0 i 've had the fried oysters before , and they were pretty good .
0 this lunch kinda sucked .
0 a native all my life and never been , finally went last summer .
0 why it 's locked i do n't know .
0 sadly this one did n't do that for me .
0 this restaurant is horrible .
0 the waitress was rude and tried to rush us .
0 the only oyster on the menu is a terrible patty of some kind .
0 i found this restaurant online and in my hotel room magazine .
0 sadly we were disappointed with our meal .
0 we were in an area with a server , but the service was terrible .
0 i 've never seen it somewhere stating they only take cash .
0 are u kidding me ?
0 the food was ok but it 's not memorable .
0 imitation crab & lots of filling .
0 so i do n't need to tell you how nasty that was .
0 my house made chips were good & cole slaw had very little flavor .
0 so i was like dang !
0 my return is questionable .
0 first thing they said to us was , we only accept cash .
0 guess what , no fresh oysters .
0 the beer was cold and that is the only reason they got one star .
0 i was embarrassed because he was my guest and it was my idea .
0 if a cold beer is all you want , go for it .
0 this place is a pittsburgh legend u got ta stop in .
0 the oysters are also old , as in not fresh .
0 just checked it out for the first time .
0 kind of disappointed but it was five dollars for the shrimp basket i got .
0 the shrimp does n't have any flavor and just tastes like grease .
0 i was the girl who came in tonight , alone , around 8pm !
0 _num_ minutes later , nothing .
0 eventually i had enough and left , which they still probably did n't notice .
0 avoid at all costs !
0 i do not recommend this restaurant .
0 the fish sandwich is bland on a generic bun .
0 the soup was nothing to write home about .
0 the fries were generic .
0 long wait time for initial service and drink refills .
0 just not what i had in mind .
0 i wo n't be going back .
0 when the oysters came out , they did n't even look like oysters .
0 they were very flat ... thinner than your typical frozen chicken nugget .
0 not much oyster taste , just the taste of the breading .
0 this was some of the worst pizza i 've ever had .
0 this does n't generally happen to me .
0 i could n't eat anymore .
0 this place is awful .
0 they screwed up my order and refused to fix it .
0 its really too bad , they are super close to my apartment .
0 i 'm upset and offended .
0 but the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude .
0 had the gyro and added feta .
0 bottle of coke had icy slush in it .
0 update - went back another time and the pizza was mediocre at best .
0 possibly the worst pizza i have ever eaten .
0 this would n't even qualify as pizza in north jersey .
0 female manager on duty asked for $ _num_ in exchange for a pizza .
0 if i could give zero stars i would .
0 the eastern european girl at the register is awful .
0 she should probably get fired .
0 the pizza at this place is o.k .
0 last night i decided to give it another try and got crappy mozzarella sticks .
0 the meat in the steak sandwich was like dog food .
0 i 'd never had the food before .
0 i usually get the steak salad which used to be good .
0 the last _num_ times getting it , i have had issues .
0 i gave the bartender $ _num_ and only received $ _num_ back .
0 i can not eat this .
0 sticky floors , bad smell , just general lack of housekeeping .
0 not sure why people like it so much .
0 if we had been drinking we would n't care .
0 maybe they had a bad day .
0 one other person tried it and would not eat it .
0 the fish n chips were not good .
0 the fries were soggy and soft , fish mediocre .
0 will not go eat there again !
0 there 's a reason why this place has no reviews .
0 it 's never open ... not even at 6:30 pm on a thursday .
0 i guess i was supposed to know that it was closed .
0 needless to say , i probably wo n't be back .
0 this is a very odd restaurant .
0 i was here once and probably wo n't be back .
0 you can definitely get better vietnamese elsewhere in the city .
0 she could n't believe that i said that .
0 i feel like she treated me like a criminal .
0 the service as mentioned was poor .
0 this place does decent thai food , but is nothing special .
0 this was the single worst thai meal i have ever had in my life .
0 this proved to have been a massive error in judgement on all our parts .
0 the first thing i ordered was a bowl of lemongrass soup .
0 we will not be back .
0 the wonton soup was horrible .
0 when i walked in the place was empty .
0 first thing i noticed is the place was an absolute sauna .
0 she shrugged and did not seem interested .
0 i ordered the lemon grass soup with shrimp and the papaya salad .
0 i would not order this again .
0 water glass was refilled promptly the one time it was starting to look empty .
0 the pad thai was bland and generic , and tasted almost gummy .
0 and i would n't have minded if the food had been amazing .
0 but sadly , it was n't .
0 we were seated immediately because it was n't too crowded ( bad sign ) .
0 did they think they could get away with it and we would n't notice ?
0 but then i got my chicken lemongrass soup .
0 it was so tiny and there was hardly any chicken in it .
0 waiter was awful and food ( pad thai ) was not much better .
0 this is by far the worst thai restaurant i 've ever been to .
0 the servers are rude and slow , and the food is awful .
0 just had the panang tofu for lunch , and was crazy underwhelmed .
0 this trip was bad , even for the price .
0 there was no sorry , we 're working on it ... etc .
0 no explanation at all was given .
0 i would not recommend this place to anyone .
0 terrible terrible customer service .
0 poor service , awful attitudes and sub-par food .
0 thai tea was no bueno .
0 i 'll probably not be back .
0 there was just one table of _num_ seated and eating when i arrived .
0 and , a table of _num_ leaving and all paying separately .
0 all that said , the huge table of _num_ had left .
0 but , no such luck .
0 the food came out quickly enough .
0 but it was quite underwhelming .
0 i settled with the thai fried rice with beef .
0 there was a ton of thai basil in the dish which was quite overwhelming .
0 i chose the hot and sour soup .
0 the soup was neither hot in temperature or spice but it certainly was sour .
0 however , last night 's dinner was just plain bad .
0 it was also virtually tasteless .
0 the food is bland , bland bland .
0 the inside of the resturant is cramped and poorly maintained .
0 i decided to play it safe and ordered the broccoli in garlic sauce .
0 do n't waste your time or money .
0 rude service , and pizza was subpar .
0 na ... wo n't be back !
0 random pizza toppings on lettuce ) this time around .
0 it really is pure torture sometimes .
0 but no biggie - we agree to split into different tables .
0 ridiculous , especially if they were expecting us to be there .
0 an extra large pizza was so small it barely fed my wife and i .
0 also the pizza was bad .
0 way overpriced and service was n't great .
0 i only gave them _num_ stars because the pizza itself was pretty good .
0 i ca n't imagine anyone liking this super bland cardboard !
0 i just do n't get how anyone could like it ?
0 no taste at all .
0 both had no flavor and the crust was chewy and lousy .
0 no sauce much and cheap cheese .
0 somewhat generic , but the espresso gets the job done .
0 it was quite small though .
0 average pittsburgh pizza and fried stuff pile , nothing special though .
0 fried items arrive a little on the cold and soggy side .
0 you know , standard italian hoagie .
0 i substituted steamed rice for the fried rice .
0 it was like an old sweet an sour sauce with a little spice .
0 i could barely pick the shrimp out because the sauce was that gross .
0 hope i have better luck next time !
0 i just ate half of a cockroach .
0 the food was unremarkable .
0 every time i have been to cafe sam i have been very disappointed .
0 got ta say , i 'm not a fan of this place .
0 confusing , and a pain .
0 but over the years it has gone down hill .
0 i wo n't go back .
0 my girlfriend had a similarly bland meal .
0 down the street is a better option - wish they were open for lunch .
0 under no circumstances would i eat here again .
0 but oh , how the standards have fallen !
0 looking back , i am glad it happened that way .
0 items seem overcooked or undercooked .
0 this was probably the worst plain cake donut i 've ever had .
0 it was dry , not at all crispy , and had no flavor .
0 i could n't even finish it .
0 i did n't find it to be anything special .
0 i am positive this bakery used to be better ... something has changed there .
0 it should have been a clue when they were soggy .
0 after my most recent experience , however , i will never be coming back .
0 she refused , and again tried to place the blame on me .
0 and sure enough , cue tuesday -- no call .
0 she failed to follow-up when she promised .
0 did i mention the cake was dry ?
0 i ordered a long john which looked pretty good .
0 unfortunately it was n't .
0 i ate maybe a bite or two before offering it to a coworker .
0 so many great bakeries in pittsburgh so i would not go back .
0 she showed me two options and i chose one .
0 it was also very dry .
0 they said they had an appointment to taste wedding cakes .
0 it all comes down to the crust -- i threw it out .
0 i had small cheese steak sub - asking only for mayo and lettuce .
0 mixed in with this were some dried herbs - maybe an italian mix ?
0 all i could taste was the overwhelming chemical , fake garlic flavor .
0 i mean thin like salad dressing , runny , thin .
0 this stuff tasted like really cheap , bad , ranch dressing .
0 while we are talking about the meat - why use this garbage ?
0 i am paying almost _num_ bucks for this sub .
0 well , this too was a massive disappointment .
0 bad sauce with flavorless cheese .
0 yes , more for the garbage .
0 we ended up throwing out about _num_ % of what we paid for .
0 they just lost a loyal customer ... never again .
0 ordered _num_ cuts to eat in and _num_ and a hoagie to go ... .
0 they get _num_ star because less was not an option .
0 so i ordered _num_ for myself and my gf .
0 i get there and the total is over $ _num_ !
0 two and a half dollars more is not a little .
0 swimming i tell you swimming in grease !
0 and that its all the owners fault about the price .
0 poor food poor excuses and apparently poor ownership .
0 the crust was not like usual and to much sauce .
0 i used to love this place , but the service is horrible now .
0 if you want something delivered you have to wait about _num_ hours .
0 our food is always wrong .
0 will not be coming back .
0 it was all i could do not to make a scene .
0 fuck that i do n't need to be disrespected like that .
0 they use some oil which smell different that killed the taste of my pizza .
0 also , the toppings were not greatly blended , just rather sprinkled .
0 did n't even enjoy the pizza crust .
0 avoid at all costs .
0 reviews but they let me down .
0 the barber could not even cut a straight fade .
0 i ordered here after the many good reviews but was quite disappointed .
0 the pizza was n't terrible but it certainly was n't good in my opinion .
0 zero flavor and the mushrooms were canned .
0 so it was no discount at all .
0 i can not review the food .
0 i did not get a chance to eat there .
0 all the white people get to eat , we do not ?
0 the woman who answered the phone said yes to both so i rushed over .
0 assuming this was due to the discount , i did n't complain .
0 receive my check to find out it was all full price .
0 she admitted it was she who answered yet refused to accommodate her mistake .
0 i do n't normally feel compelled to complain but that is ridiculous .
0 a subpar meal and subpar service in addition to false marketing .
0 this was flat , one note .
0 yep , this place is terrible .
0 update : _num_ hours later and still feel sick from this meal .
0 the flavor in the tiki masala was so bland .
0 they both looked old and one of them smelled old .
0 both of these dishes were extremely unappealing as well .
0 i sadly had to throw most of it away .
0 i did n't even know you could go wrong with chicken marsala !
0 i can easily say this is the worst indian food i have ever eaten .
0 maybe i went on a bad day but the food was pretty darn terrible .
0 but the noodles are a disgrace .
0 no way , dudes .
0 go down the street and get some tastier food at tram 's kitchen .
0 i 'm not joking about the water .
0 pho broth takes like nine hours to make .
0 in fact i was quite disappointed .
0 based on all the other reviews , probably safe to stick to pho .
0 if you have an emergency , go to the vca castle shannon animal hospital .
0 for everything else , try the cat clinic .
0 i asked about late hours but the latest appointment is at _num_ pm .
0 i start work at _num_ am .
0 i do n't need to receive attitude from a receptionist .
0 clearly , they do n't need my business .
0 i felt like i spent $ _num_ for absolutely nothing .
0 i think i 'll be going elsewhere next time .
0 it was a mess .
0 i stop in every week for it .
0 last week , i got a large and went back for more .
0 but , lately it 's been hit or miss .
0 it is all watered down and gross .
0 if your not a chain smoker , opt for takeout .
0 the bar reeks of smoke and the bar table feels sticky .
0 the only good thing is that the drinks are cheap .
0 but i really would n't recommend going there .
0 he obviously did n't care at all .
0 i called restaurant.com for a refund , and told them what he said .
0 i did n't get a chance to try any food and i never will .
0 this place is terrible .
0 tandoori chicken does n't taste like one etc .
0 decor is tasteless and old .
0 carpet looks really dirty .
0 i 'm definitely not coming back .
0 seem nice but the food is not that good .
0 we also had a masala and that too was not great .
0 this was not nearly as good .
0 went there with friends for the first time and felt quite disappointed .
0 food was dry and the sauces were watery .
0 i do n't know why all the hype on this place .
0 trust me , you 'll be glad you did .
0 sadly , i was disappointed .
0 the karaoke host was just lame .
0 and he had a cd setup -- seriously , cds , in _num_ .
0 it was just really lackluster in my opinion .
0 the karaoke had a very limited selection .
0 wo n't be going back .
0 i do n't understand why people love this place .
0 the bar food is typical .
0 if you want no frills beer and bar food , they are no frills .
0 the place smells awful and the workers are grumpy .
0 there are other italian grocery stores close by .
0 i rushed to tan today after work .
0 i 'm weird like that .
0 it 's just generic stuff .
0 like i said , olive garden , only local .
0 so i would n't go back .
0 it 's not my kind of food , or place .
0 the other day someone asked me ... where 's your favourite vietnamese food ?
0 i do n't even care about the decor or seating etc .
0 it looked a mess .
0 honestly , it looked like someone had already starting eating this .
0 but as i ate , i was even more disappointed .
0 they hardly put any fresh vegetables in it , and the vermicelli is overcooked .
0 the spring rolls were completely soggy .
0 i do n't think their menu is limited though , it seemed fairly typical .
0 my boyfriend ordered the pork rice vermicelli bowl .
0 however , my dish was nothing to brag about .
0 it did n't taste bad by any means , but not restaurant quality .
0 my boyfriend 's dinner was a real disappointment , however .
0 it almost looked like boiled ground beef .
0 i do n't understand this either .
0 the rolls were extremely bland and chewy .
0 the sauce that was served with it did n't do much to save it .
0 the beef pho was sub par .
0 also : $ _num_ for pho does not make for hole-in-the-wall pricing .
0 for starters , the portion of the pho is extremely skimpy !
0 seriously , would it kill you to add more rice noodles ?
0 let me tell you , this place is a big let down .
0 i do n't know why people are giving it such rave reviews .
0 the portions are tiny , and the pho broth leaves you unsatisfied .
0 it lacks the true flavor that pho broth should have .
0 i quickly devoured the tiny appetizer in _num_ bites .
0 it took forever for the food to arrive , it was a big bowl .
0 so highly disappointed with my pho experience .
0 the restaurant setting is very typical of a vietnamese restaurant .
0 the menu is small with very limited choices .
0 then we had _num_ different kind of pho for our main entree .
0 there was also excessive msg in the soup dishes .
0 the food is cheap .
0 this is something that tram 's has gotten badly wrong every time i visited .
0 personally , i do n't see what is so special about it .
0 they 're big , but again nothing special .
0 at tram 's , the pho bowl is small .
0 the taste is reminiscent of pho but is n't quite right .
0 this was n't it .
0 it was dark and crowded ( and a little bit dingy ) .
0 bad service , bland food .
0 do n't believe the hype .
0 i think i chose wrong .
0 ordered the pho and it was mediocre and forgettable .
0 another sour note , they dropped off some spring rolls at our table .
0 later on , we saw them on our bill .
0 they were overpriced , and not worth it .
0 tram 's kitchen in my opinion is not really worth it .
0 the food was mediocre and full of msg .
0 the pho was nothing special and place was small and looks dirty .
0 my total bill does n't reflect the price of the dishes i ordered .
0 my bill came out to be higher than what 's listed on the menu .
0 the service was okay , they were really nice and never rude .
0 the portions were really small .
0 i gave this place two tries and was disappointed both times .
0 either way , i do n't understand the hype surrounding this place .
0 the color of the dish was as bland as the taste .
0 as for the atmosphere , not a big deal for me .
0 if that 's not enough to stop you , read on .
0 bland and disappointing , the pho most of all .
0 the dish was dry and lacked flavor .
0 as it were , i was n't impressed .
0 on top of that , my meatballs were quite dry , even in soup .
0 the service , was not the best .
0 pho is ok , not bad .
0 this is the worst .
0 i will never try it again .
0 maybe i 'm spoiled with good vietnamese food but this was terrible .
0 also questionable tofu in the vegetarian spring rolls .
0 i 'm vietnamese , worse viet food ever !
0 maybe i just did n't order the right dish .
0 i ordered the beef vermicelli bowl , one egg roll , one spring roll .
0 my husband and i stayed in pittsburgh for weeks and wanted to have pho .
0 i read about good stuff here but was very disappointed .
0 we have had vietnamese food in other states before but here is the worst .
0 soup has no flavour and it seems to have excessive msg .
0 egg roll and fried rice is too greasy .
0 service is not friendly .
0 turns out this was n't the case .
0 the entire restaurant could use a thorough cleaning .
0 i left , and do n't intend to return .
0 try tom 's diner or eat 'n park instead .
0 heck , go to a grocery store instead .
0 the food is n't something to rave about but it 's edible .
0 never a dull moment .
0 finding a good ol ' diner in pittsburgh is n't exactly easy .
0 the restaurant has the diner feel , no doubt .
0 you ca n't mess it up ) .
0 the food ranges from mediocre to bland .
0 worst food in pittsburgh .
0 i think the food is boring .
0 _num_ but i rounded down .
0 i do n't want to be too mean .
0 had no desire to eat throughout the day .
0 this was some of the worst food i 've ever had .
0 the two times i 've been there i was unhappy .
0 cheap , average diner food .
0 ummm , we 're pretty sure my boyfriend got food poisoning here .
0 the food is crap .
0 they screwed up a club sandwich & fries .
0 kind of gross if you ask me .
0 food can be pretty good , service can be pretty bad .
0 so , i came to the diner having already eaten a light breakfast .
0 the toast was good , but i was too full to keep eating .
0 based on this one experience , i would come only for the pancakes .
0 service was really bad even though the place was half empty .
0 located in not such a great part of town .
0 food is just ok , grease upon grease .
0 waitresses do not make much of an effort .
0 we ordered wings and pierogies for appetizers , for which we waited _num_ minutes .
0 the wings were dry .
0 he did nothing to compensate us for the long wait .
0 this place is one of only a couple open in the burgh _num_ hours .
0 that 's an automatic star in this dead city .
0 the only items that are good there are the bacon and toast .
0 the food just is n't that great .
0 yeah , that place is that old and that outdated .
0 no parking = no visit from me .
0 - it 's _num_ and they have no website or menu .
0 it would take less than _num_ day of their time .
0 - they want $ _num_ for cheese on their eggs .
0 their chicken is better too .
0 a few of us went out after late night bowling to get some food .
0 it 's clear that cleanliness is not a priority here .
0 and the bathroom looks and smells like something out of the movie saw .
0 i do n't have time for this , i 'm very busy '' .
0 no need to be nasty .
0 typical diner look and menu .
0 i really do n't get the hype as the food was average at best .
0 puts it into a glass and serves it to someone else .
0 do not make the mistake and eat here .
0 overall , my experience eating here has been inconsistent .
0 when it was brought back , there was a small hair in it .
0 soup not hot , waitress and cook fighting loudly .
0 cash only is not an acceptable policy in _num_ .
0 this trend has to stop , it is not ok .
0 i refuse to patronize any business that only accepts cash .
0 this is a scam and highly unacceptable .
0 i dropped off my standard prescription today , with the head pharmacist .
0 he could n't have told me that prior ?
0 i could taste absolutely nothing from her veal .
0 the salad was basic iceberg lettuce and a few other veggies .
0 then the bill came to over $ _num_ .
0 it was truly , truly just plain sad .
0 do n't waste your time !
0 after they microwaved it it was barely fit to eat .
0 some had flavorless chicken piccata , fish and eggplant parmigiana .
0 the only thing with an aroma in this place was the tomato sauce .
0 waited _num_ minutes for two glasses of wine .
0 it was very awkward considering it was a first date .
0 the drinks took forever , i had something floating in my wine .
0 the soup tasted spoiled , the tomatoes in my salad were frozen and mushy .
0 this place is trashy .
0 total dive bar with awful food and service .
0 neither of us touched our dinner , we were afraid to eat it .
0 diners beware , spend your money elsewhere .
0 not much for atmosphere .
0 the service , in my opinion , is often quite rude .
0 the `` ambiance '' is loud , dark , dingy and depressing .
0 sorry , but i just do n't get it .
0 this place is hyped as the be all end all of burgers .
0 the reason why i rate this place low is the atmosphere is abysmal .
0 i 've had better burgers almost everywhere .
0 i dropped them off while i parked the car .
0 she said they would n't seat them because i was n't there .
0 the burger was pretty good but , i 've had much better .
0 what i really did n't like about this place was the service .
0 we had to flag down our waitress just to get refills .
0 we were rushed through our meals like we were n't wanted !
0 not sure what all the hype is about .
0 but the burger was n't memorable at all .
0 we proceed to wait another _num_ minutes until a _num_ top opened up .
0 never understood all the hype about this place .
0 the burgers are rather bland and burnt .
0 and the wait was always ridiculous to boot .
0 in practice , it 's not very pleasant to go there .
0 every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward .
0 the burger just falls apart in your hands ( or onto your lap ) .
0 i had a bacon cheeseburger and it was okay .
0 i did like the home fries , very yummy !
0 in all honesty i would 've rather had five guys or in-n-out burgers .
0 i 've eaten there many times in the hopes that maybe i missed something .
0 oh but it 's not .
0 it 's not me .
0 it 's just not that good .
0 burgers are adequate - nothing special .
0 order something other than a burger and you do n't get much better .
0 this was my first and last time at this restaurant .
0 but i did n't send it back because i never send anything back .
0 i just ate it and it was a sloppy , greasy mess .
0 the bread was cheap and tasteless .
0 the home fries were just diced potatoes .
0 also , not one of us got ours cooked as ordered .
0 i just do n't understand the appeal .
0 i would consider a _num_ star rating if it were n't for them .
0 the decor is old school and seems satisfied in it 's current state .
0 however , it was absolutely nothing special .
0 also , the home fries were just mediocre .
0 i do n't understand all the rave reviews for this place .
0 as for me , i do n't think i 'll be back .
0 there did n't seem to be any seasoning of the meat whatsoever .
0 bland would be an understatement .
0 i had the kelly burger and it was just extremely massive and greasy .
0 the burger was so-so with little flavor , which was very disappointing .
0 the waitress made it seem as though it was my fault for bringing him .
0 the potato salad was awesome everything else was super sub par .
0 this is supposed to be the best burgers in the 'burgh .
0 if that were the case , i 'd stick to making my own .
0 baby on board , we walked in and waited to be greeted .
0 the inside looked a bit old and run down .
0 i would not suggest bringing a baby here .
0 the potatoes were very bland despite being served with warm butter on the side .
0 bad for an adult who is looking for something tasty .
0 this was not the case .
0 my burger was as dry as a burnt piece of chicken .
0 overall , tessaro 's fell flat and left me hung out to dry .
0 went once , only due to bad weather , and would never go again .
0 mediocre food and mediocre service .
0 _num_ of us came here for dinner and ordered burgers and drinks .
0 bad customer service and to be honest we had bad service all around .
0 they also have a wind problem every time the front door is open .
0 clearly , customer service nor quality of food are valued .
0 the dust does n't end there .
0 _num_ of us plus drinks was $ _num_ .
0 worst service and seating ever !
0 food is ok but the service is a thumb down .
0 i would never come back .
0 for me , eating at tessaro 's is like eating a costco hotdog .
0 maybe i should cut down on the costco dogs ?
0 staff was friendly and drinks were reasonable but nothing to rave about .
0 however , i wo n't be back .
0 was really excited to try this out .
0 did n't wait long to be seated .
0 but waited over _num_ minutes for them to take our order .
0 waitresses were overwhelmed and avoided us .
0 lack concern makes me wonder if we will be back .
0 the wait for someone to take our drink order was rather long .
0 i 'm used to ordering medium and getting medium well at least .
0 i do n't see why people really like this place .
0 they were soggy , and not crispy at all .
0 there are better places in pittsburgh to get a burger and fries .
0 it seems as if this place is now more hit or miss .
0 the food went from amazing to mediocre without missing a beat .
0 even worse , no seasoning whatsoever .
0 so , i am fed up with bad service from this state farm office .
0 just my experience , but come on people , really ?
0 i went to this restaurant saturday for the first time .
0 we walked in and there were already some people waiting for a table .
0 i was excited about dining at this place before _num_ minutes of frustration .
0 stuffed mushrooms , but my seafood pasta just came up bland and too oily .
0 the broccoli in it was overcooked and the shrimp were undercooked .
0 if i could give negative stars i certainly would for this place .
0 i walked in sat down , greeted by friendly staff and great decor .
0 we sat outside and the service was very slow .

0 the food is bad !
0 this appetizer reminded me of my mother 's irish cooking : tasteless .
0 a simple addition of caramelized onions would have solved this problem .
0 entree _num_ : beer battered fish and mac and cheese .
0 entree _num_ : fish tacos .
0 ok , so they were n't bad , but the fish was dry .
0 the attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream .
0 the chef , however , needs a bit of training .
0 i am hoping that my experience here was an off night .

0 both the waitress and the bartender were downright hostile .
0 the food is mediocre ( at best ) .
0 the place is a total dump .
0 we ate breakfast food at 2:30 am after the bars closed .

0 yes bread , this is not your best .
0 contrary to popular believe , this is not traditional italian !
0 this is what some would refer to as , terrible and heavy .
0 words could not describe my disappointment .
0 i 'll admit it , i 'm already an italian food snob .
0 is this what italian food in pittsburgh has come too ?
0 imitation crab meat at an italian restaurant does n't fly .
0 do n't worry but i wo n't come close to this restaurant again .
0 i was n't really a fan .
0 i 've made much better at home .
0 which was dry , overcooked and lukewarm .

0 do n't expect fresh food .
0 i was extremely disappointed w/ my experience at alexander 's last evening .
0 i had visited this restaurant in the past and remember it being much better ?
0 first of all , house chianti tasted like vinegar .
0 however , we were not offered any and forgot about it until this morning .
0 i am _num_ and i was probably youngest patron .
0 if you are looking for culinary experience avoid it .
0 it was a small side salad of iceberg lettuce and croutons with italian dressing .
0 what i received reminded me of mrs grass soup .
0 really bad italian food .
0 probably the worst i 've ever had .
0 the worst american version of italian food .
0 if you 're famous , why is there never anyone in your restaurant ?
0 the sandwich itself was , well , mediocre at best .
0 prices were okay , but no great bargain .
0 i have n't been back .
0 i rarely write negative reviews .
0 the salad was nothing special .
0 the spring rolls were nothing special and heavy on something off flavored .
0 the server got my order wrong .
0 i think it was overpriced for a pittsburgh restaurant as well .
0 this place was horrible .
0 i was very excited to try this place .
0 the pad thai was dry and tasteless .
0 i agree _num_ % on maggie g 's review .
0 ill pass i 've had better thai for less .
0 no more trying out different thai places in the city .
0 the food at thai cuisine is more pitiful than my sense of direction .
0 the carrots and broccoli was cooked beyond recognition .
0 okay thai food , nothing special , and overpriced .
0 ordered the eggplant with shrimp , veggie fried rice , and chicken satay .
0 eggplant was okay but lacked adequate quantities of shrimp .
0 however , would n't say this is very authentic thai food .
0 this was gross and a waste of _num_ dollars .
0 thai gourmet a few blocks down is awesome ... too bad they were closed .
0 the spring rolls were good and the dipping sauce was ok , nothing special .
0 i did n't think it was that good .
0 worst thai restaurant in pittsburgh .
0 i was greatly disappointed by this restaurant .
0 the place was very busy and noisy .
0 further , there did n't seem to be any seasoning on the steak .
0 it was tough and boring .
0 unfortunately , my head is sometimes up my own behind .
0 the place was much less noisy and crowded at my second visit .
0 the wings were awful .
0 they were large , tough and tasteless .
0 the sauce they were drowning in seemed to have almost a chemical taste .
0 the pasta dish would have been very good had it been seasoned enough .
0 the shrimp were perfectly cooked , though , and i was thankful for that .
0 nevertheless , i will not go there , again .
0 do n't waste your money !
0 my favorite sauce was the honey jalapeno .
0 they also did away with the _num_ cent wing night .
0 i just had the worst meal ever here .
0 not a big deal just thought it odd .
0 just meh sorta flavorless .
0 good place _num_ a large group to drink get apps tho .
0 went to getaway last night for famous fajitas .
0 decided to give them another chance and was disappointed .
0 5:30 on a saturday and only two other tables were occupied .
0 at noon on a friday i called getaway to place an order for wings .
0 i told my friend to forget about it .
0 ( oh , heck no ! )
0 my wife ended up going to the bathroom for paper towels .
0 what an awful experience .
0 my steak hoagie was actually two mini sandwiches .
0 i would n't recommend it .
0 in a word : forgettable .
0 the last take-out pie we got was less than pleasing to the eye .
0 it 's not 5-star , it 's pizza .
0 i suspect it would be really delicious cold , for breakfast .
0 it was late and on the way home with nothing at home to eat .
0 stopped by fiori 's , have n't been there in years .
0 the pizza was just sweet without much other taste , almost like ketchup !
0 this place is popular , but it is just is not for me !
0 i really do n't understand the hype of this place .
0 the pizza was just ok .
0 it was decently greasy and the crust was n't all that special .
0 sure , it 's friday a busy night so an hour seemed reasonable .
0 it took another _num_ minutes before he actually got the pizza .
0 _num_ hour and _num_ mins is ridiculously long to wait !
0 they should have cut off orders if they were that overwhelmed !
0 the sauce tasted like sugar and the crust was bland .
0 after that , everything else is what i consider the personal taste part .
0 the sauce was to sweet and the cheese was not right to me .
0 i wo n't be going back , just because my personal taste .
0 that was really unprofessional .
0 the bottom and the top rated with grease .
0 the red sauce tasted like it was ketchup with sugar added .
0 loaded with cheese that had pools of grease swimming on it .
0 it was still dripping with grease .
0 i removed the cheese and just ate the crust with the vegetables .
0 i assure you this place is n't it .
0 after all the garbage food you get unbelievable attitude .
0 the pie it self was a real mess .
0 the dough is some of the worst dough i have had yet in pittsburgh .
0 it is very dense and flavorless with no crunch at all .
0 its a dry dough too , very dry .
0 the sauce is very forgettable and watery .
0 and just leave this one alone .
0 i am giving it a _num_ out of _num_ .
0 really do n't get the high praise for their pizza .
0 their sauce is so thin and tasteless .
0 the cheese is almost too much .
0 i was quickly greeted by paul - who was great !
0 they continued to stare for several minutes , unbelievably unprofessional .
0 sadly i will never purchase a vehicle here again because of this experience .
0 which you failed , because of your tire .
0 you could leave a message , but they 'll never get back to you .
0 do n't waste your time and money here .
0 then shortly after , i needed to replace the alternator or the like .
0 this was a friday , and he said he 'd call back on monday .
0 monday , tuesday and wednesday came and went .
0 first , their clothing is arranged by color , not by size .
0 the upscale prices did not match the dingy and dirty store .
0 we wo n't be back to this one .
0 was n't worth it for me .
0 just really lots of junk .
0 it is a cash only establishment and the staff was very rude .
0 i 'd rather spend my money at goodwill !
0 this used to be one of my favorite thrift stores .
0 it is now grossly over priced .
0 and it seems like everybody that goes in there are trashy and rude .
0 it tends to bring in the worst of people .
0 get the diagnosis and get several estimates to compare .
0 it seems like all these hvac guys are out to take advantage .
0 do not use , awful experience !
0 my house is under 1,000 sf .
0 he was there for approximately _num_ minutes .
0 i feel ripped off .
0 very sad to find that donuts are made the day before .
0 same goes for the provolone wheel .
0 the bread was not fresh either .
0 i 'm genuinely disappointed with the recent changes .
0 we stuck it out and left with no intention to return .
0 the icing was not damaged though as they were so stale they were hard .
0 so i contacted this bakery for a wedding cake approximately _num_ months in advance .
0 i do n't regret it at all .
0 the cupcakes were average at best .
0 sadly , yelp failed me this time around .
0 ( _num_ ) i called multiple times but could n't reach anyone .
0 ( _num_ ) left messages and no one called me back .
0 ( _num_ ) they do n't have ready access to email .
0 if you send them an email , they do n't check it .
0 they just do n't run a very professional operation .
0 only had a bite of that and threw it away .
0 owner is a terrible terrible person .
0 tossed me out for no good reason .
0 it was like pizza soup in a crust bowl .
0 they do not cook directly on the brick though , they use pizza screens .
0 they are wasting so much money on cheese its sad .
0 fake words aside , this pizza really sucks guys .
0 this was our first time trying this place since moving to castle shannon .
0 the pizza was really really greasy .
0 we also got an order of _num_ hot wings .
0 they were also extremely greasy and had zero flavor of any kind of sauce .
0 their texture was rubbery and they had a `` reheated '' taste to them .
0 they were pretty terrible .
0 we wo n't be ordering from here again .
0 completely unprofessional and ridiculous .
0 none of this is exaggeration .
0 almost every order i 've placed had something forgotten or incorrect .
0 literally the worst experience ever .
0 yelp as well as the online website said they close at _num_ .
0 seriously the worst mcdonalds i 've ever been to .
0 service is always slow .
0 but the situation inside is fairly ridiculous .
0 every mcdonalds has employees that hate their job , but never show it .
0 i hate this location .
0 every time , we have a worse experience with customer service .
0 my cashier never handed me a cup for my drink .
0 over time i 've been ignored , greeted with `` what do you want ?
0 will defiantly not go there again !
0 this leaves the meat dry and tasteless .
0 hostess was great , service was adequate .
0 the food is terrible .
0 if i could give zero stars i would .
0 the entrees are horrible .
0 the apps were good but do n't eat dinner you 'll regret it .
0 this used to be one of our favorite restaurants .
0 the new pitas tasted like a doughy pancake .
0 my wife 's dinner was bland .
0 it was that bad .
0 my hope is that they fix their problems .
0 avoid at all costs .
0 i would n't go back .
0 well , this place is beyond horrible .
0 if i could give negative stars i would .
0 the service , however , was terrible .
0 no wonder the service was horrible !
0 will never stop here again .
0 horrible , rude service .
0 _num_ minute wait for fast food ?
0 made me feel uncomfortable , he was kinda nasty and condescending .
0 however , every times i drive thru pittsburgh , i always stopped here .
0 furthermore , i have ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce .
0 shrimp was hard to chew .
0 there was no aroma from garlic or onion .
0 i suspect this is probably made by the guy who station the fryer .
0 i purchase those passing pittsburgh , not really possible asking for refund .
0 it was so bad , i would not dear to try again .
0 i could n't eat it .
0 this is n't the first time that i have had this problem here .
0 i wo n't be back .
0 no changing tables in the bathroom .
0 no chop sticks or soy sauce unless you ask for it .
0 interior is dark and dated .
0 dry rice , no flavor , greasy .
0 wonton soup and a mediocre fortune earns this one ( _num_ ) golden star .
0 it was my last time , i will ever stop again .
0 stopped in with my daughter we just wanted something small to eat .
0 i left and very disappointed .
0 i have been a customer of sesame inn for many , many years .
0 two stars because they seem to not be able to get it together .
0 people were sat after us and have already received food .
0 either case , i 'm not thrilled .
0 not that the food was bad it just was n't good !
0 never ever get the all-you-can-eat .
0 they give you nigiri sushi instead of sashimi .
0 also , service was unfriendly .
0 my son and i stopped by china gate after a movie in the galleria .
0 there was no way this order was prepared and cooked that fast .
0 there is such a thing as food too fast .
0 tonight was the worst experience we have had for a very long time .
0 and another which was not the one my husband had ordered .
0 the restaurant is understaffed , poorly managed , and the staff is badly trained .
0 one star for the unpleasant experience i have had at this store .
0 it 's a shame he could not assist me with some grace and respect .
0 i will not be returning here for any musical needs .
0 i was a bridesmaid very recently and the bride got her dress here .
0 the dress comes in _num_ months later and is the wrong color .
0 i would never recommend this boutique to a bride unless you want added stress .
0 there are plenty of other bridal salons that would be much nicer and accommodating .
0 incredibly unfriendly staff , completely clueless consultant .
0 if i asked the price , she did n't know and did n't look .
0 think twice people before going here .
0 update : i received a very much appreciated phone call from the owner today .
0 she stated that she would go ask to see if something could be done .
0 they of course could care less about me .
0 what horrible service this place gives !
0 i wish i could give this no stars and a thumbs down !
0 the bride chose a dress hoping it would look better in a smaller size .
0 they know my measurements , they should know what size i should get !
0 the cost of the alterations were $ _num_ !
0 to date that has not happened .
0 the selection was not unique , though there were plenty of dresses .
0 it seems ridiculous , actually .
0 in addition , the knowledge of the associate was lackluster .
0 the oven was way too hot for this type of pizza .
0 it was also an outrageous $ _num_ dollars .
0 it was also fairly small , but that was almost to be expected .
0 we also shared a pasta dish which was incredibly overpriced .
0 we also had a serious problem with the timing of the food .
0 hmm a bit misleading .
0 but my date returned and relaxed with a glass of wine as we chatted .
0 the blond hostess refused .
0 as for the food and drink , it was just fine .
0 i wo n't be coming here again .
0 essentially three pieces of toast with various toppings .
0 certainly , this was not worth the $ _num_ price .
0 our server was attentive , almost to a fault .
0 way overpriced for just ok food .
0 on a tuesday night , there was a long wait .
0 the food was prompt , and the salad was more than enough to share .
0 the pizza was simply ok .
0 also , do not use multiple credit cards .
0 our pizza was burnt .
0 it tasted like charcoal .
0 but told our server we could not eat the burnt pizza .
0 it was cold and not a good portion .
0 i got a huge hot pepper that burnt the crap out of my lip .
0 just not a good value for the $ .
0 there were n't even many toppings to make it soggy .
0 probably give it another shot but not my first choice considering the prices .
0 i ordered the margarita , sauce , cheese and basil .
0 it was a wet tasteless mess .
0 i may return if craving a good caesar .
0 we will not be going back .
0 friday night is apparently not the night to go .
0 you can wait for _num_ minutes at the wine bar . ''
0 we repeatedly got dirty looks from the staff throughout our meal though .
0 by 6:30 , there were still a number of empty tables .
0 then there 's the main restaurant that i really was n't that impressed with .
0 the food i ordered was penne alla vodka , which was pretty tasty .
0 but for $ _num_ , and that 's all you get ?
0 and never refilled our empty water glasses .
0 lo and behold at _num_ minutes it comes out .
0 bland and soggy as we 've ever tasted .
0 worst service in years .
0 the pasta i got was good , but nothing to write home about .
0 the only thing i will give them credit for their italian wedding soup .
0 overall , not impressed .
0 i probably wo n't return .
0 this used to be one of my absolute favorite places to eat .
0 i really like the pizza and marinated vegetables .
0 sadly i can not support a business that provides such poor service .
0 better deals and better food at a mall food court .
0 $ _num_ for wedding soup ?
0 $ _num_ for gnocchi ?
0 what was worse was the pizza was just average .
0 it 's so cold - like sit with your coat on cold .
0 we dined rather early , so there was no wait .
0 overall , a disappointing dining experience .
0 however , there were three hostesses at the bar chatting and seemingly doing nothing .
0 the restaurant was by no means crowded ( this was a sunday ) .
0 it does n't make sense .
0 the wine : _num_ inches served in a huge glass .
0 with all of the fabulous choices in the south hills , pick another destination .
0 this restaurant is going downhill .
0 first thing i knew was iffy was the meat and cheese plate .
0 they replaced the normal wooden board , and replaced it with a plate .
0 a white , boring , incredibly small plate .
0 food remains ok but prices have more than doubled .
0 i do n't return on principle .
0 their market square location worse .
0 waitress has n't checked on us in half an hour .
0 would rate the food , but have no clue because we are still waiting .
0 waiter was not thrilled to be at work on a wednesday at 5pm .
0 my pizza was okay , nothing yummy .
0 way too over priced .
0 go for drinks and nothing more .
0 i 've been wanting to try this place for awhile .
0 disappointed but not giving up , we ordered one of each and proceeded .
0 the bread was thick and doughy ( clearly a filler ) .
0 i eat out almost every night of the week .
0 it doesnt taste like an actual japanese cuisine , it is very chinese .
0 and i can smell chinese food right after a few second entering the restaurant .
0 i expected bland sushi .
0 but hey , it 's pittsburgh .
0 let 's face it , this is not japanese food .
0 the food is ok but it is really more or less chinese food .
0 man , was i wrong .
0 the sushi was not fresh .
0 the sushi was n't rolled tight either .
0 otherwise , i really would n't recommend this place to other people .
0 there are no descriptions for any of the rolls .
0 they do not offer low sodium soy sauce .
0 the wait for _num_ rolls and _num_ pieces of sashimi took over _num_ minutes .
0 actually , everything i ate was mushy .
0 the side soup is luke warm , soup should always be hot .
0 waited about another _num_ minutes after we finished our food to receive our check .
0 however , they deserve one star because they do have one amazing thing there .
0 their ginger dressing is unbelievable .
0 miso soup had an odd taste this visit .
0 our waitress was mia most of the night .
0 i did not have a good experience here tonight .
0 it was fried tofu in soy sauce with red pickled chinese chilli .
0 we ordered the filet mignon with chicken hibachi .
0 false advertising at its best -- should n't that be illegal ?
0 a group was sat without the reservation ahead of us .
0 we have been ordering food from little tokyo for almost _num_ years now .
0 over the last _num_ months i have to report they have lost their edge .
0 this is not japanese food , period .
0 i swear it was worse than my first experience .
0 the locals that like this joint must have smoker destroyed taste buds .
0 the dough has that typical bad salty cracker pittsburgh type taste to it .
0 the flavor of the dough is generic and salty .
0 the dough was also fairly dense .
0 the cheese ruined this pie .
0 all in all this pizza just sucks .
0 some good some bad .
0 even burger king does n't microwave their breakfast !
0 the chili soup was n't hot .
0 neither of us had cash on us , ( umm ... sorry ? )
0 the screens were tiny and the women 's restroom smelled of stale piss .
0 odds are , you 'd get a better experience at home .
0 filthy , bad seats , more expensive than others .
0 we wo n't return here .
0 she said she did n't care and her manager did n't care .
0 i did n't care .
0 i sat in the little snack area and drank it .
0 overpriced snacks , and the sound on the movie was awful .
0 why does this place always smell bad ?
0 this is not only a bad business practice but it is illegal and fraud .
0 food is n't that great .
0 lots of tv 's though .
0 just do n't expect to get anything else out of it .
0 the ambiance is a little strange .
0 the service was also overwhelmed and really slow .
0 the service was terrible .
0 sorry , not sorry .
0 this place does n't do it for me at all .
0 do n't bother eating here .
0 a complete waste of money , avoid at all costs .
0 avoid at all cost .
0 _num_ there service is awful , _num_ there prices are awful .
0 sad to see it go .
0 but i 'm sure the mall 's rent killed them .
0 sad to see it go .
0 at the time , it was the premier cigar shop in the pittsburgh area .
0 the store is extremely pricey and nothing really interested us .
0 last week i went in with a busted window screen frame .
0 now it wo n't fit .
0 she slowly responded `` yeah '' hardly looking up .
0 i stood there for a second and realized she was blatantly blowing me off .
0 i guess because the big box stores are cheaper and maybe more accessible .
0 i am so frustrated with this service .
0 i should have just gone to giant eagle .
0 this was a horrible experience .
0 i am extremely disappointed and will never order or recommend them for anything !
0 the galleria ... it 's definitely catered to the upper class .
0 i really do n't have much desire to go here !
0 management will not care about your complaint and certainly will not apologize .
0 and , no , i 'm not making this up .
0 to which my response would have been , `` oh i 'm so sorry .
0 none of them responded to me .
0 the management team of this mall would get negative stars if that was possible .
0 after getting my `` window '' they never showed up .
0 no call , nothing .
0 i sat around for an entire saturday waiting and no one ever called me .
0 they also promised me a partial refund for my massive inconvenience .
0 i should have refused delivery and just got my money back .
0 i asked them three times to please try and they refused all three times .
0 if you are going to shop here , do not use their delivery service .
0 wo n't be going back .
0 wo n't be going back .
0 worst experience with a hairdresser ever , at this location .
0 yeah , that 's why i booked one at your salon .
0 horrible salon ... dirty , also , just as a side note .
0 online , their women 's haircut price is quoted at $ 30+ .
0 no , she went ahead anyway .
0 so go there instead is the best advice i can give .
0 for many , many years i had the same massage therapist .
0 massage but still had a _num_ hr .
0 wait which i left to run some errands .
0 it is very disappointing after having wonderful experiences here for over _num_ decades !
0 the worst salon experience of my life .
0 i gave her the benefit of the doubt & i completely regret it .
0 the first visit took almost seven hours , not _num_ .
0 she left about 1-2 inches of my naturally black roots !
0 she 's either incompetent or she ruined my hair on purpose .
0 she damaged my hair so badly i ended up having _num_ inches cut off .
0 i would give them zero stars if that was an option .
0 they still have not apologized when they lost her insurance card .
0 i paid $ _num_ for shipping .
0 i have no clue what they gave me .
0 they just wanted to work , i guess .
0 i chose a sugar cookie and mexican cookie .
0 i 'm not wasting my calories on a bad cookie .
0 the mexican cookie was just the same consistency .
0 the lady who works their , is super rude and never smiles .
0 the customer almost feels like they are bothering the workers .
0 it 's always dirty .
0 do n't think the floor has ever been washed .
0 it 's like they hate their lives .
0 wish there was a choice of no stars .
0 there was no noise control so sleep was impossible .
0 quite possibly the worst experience i have ever had dealing with a clothing store .
0 why would i spend hundreds of dollars on more suits ?
0 overpriced merchandise that does not last .
0 even the shoes fell apart after a few months .
0 purchased two suits and other items for my son , spending over $ _num_ .
0 i could understand if they were worn a lot , but they were not .
0 my recommendation would be to not buy suits , shirts or shoes here .
0 the salespeople are not pushy .
0 the team went out of their way to get us in quickly and efficiently .
0 the closet doors would keep falling off onto my little children .
0 we called about the issue and they sent someone over right away .
0 my overall point is just be careful working with them .
0 and not giving real receipts ( they use hand written ones ! )
0 i rest my case : avoid ten toes on walnut ladies !
0 losing customers because you make them pay for wifi access priceless .
0 the coffee is okay , nothing special .
0 this place just keeps getting worse and worse .
0 started with the bathrooms ... rarely cleaned , rarely working .
0 so long story short , this place is packed .
0 it 's a little annoying .
0 i 'm not a coffee snob i can do with it or without it .
0 but it seemed like i was absolutely bothering the staff this morning .
0 i 'm not a shady side hipster but an average person in workout gear .
0 felt like i was in someone else 's hood .
0 get over yourselves people .
0 if you 've got stuff to do , do n't bother coming here .
0 they apparently do n't care about your time or money .
0 servers here can be really rude .
0 it was n't even that she said it .
0 i wo n't be back .
0 the wifi signal is weak .
0 the drinks are not so great .
0 the frozen carmel coffee drink was much better than fruit smoothie .
0 slightly better than starbucks , but that 's not saying much .
0 it 's sad to me that someone would open a coffee shop like this .
0 so i decide to try a coffee tree for once .
0 i walk in , look around , look at the menu ... hmmm .
0 sorry , just not interested .
0 it must not have been bad because i do n't remember anything about it .
0 minus _num_ stars for not being much better than starbucks .
0 unfortunately , the wi-fi here is miserable .
0 its connection is also very spotty .
0 for a coffee shop , the food and drinks here are mediocre at best .
0 that 's about where the positives stop .
0 espresso is pretty bad .
0 i must be missing something because this place seemed expensive for dry cleaning .
0 this place is out of my dry cleaning budget !
0 its owner , gary , enjoys parking in handicapped parking spaces .
0 this time , the staff were new , loud and mean .
0 as chance would have it , the owner gary was around .
0 the damage was done .
0 they just keep finding excuses and trying not to be responsible for it .
0 i interacted with staff to get help with a machine that was n't working .
0 do n't expect any help when things get ruined .
0 i usually do both dry cleaning and wash and fold here .
0 i will never do any business with this jerk off ever again .
0 i have never been treated so rudely in my entire life .
0 i told him that i would rather donate the items to a theater .
0 will never return to the store .
0 i went here to fix a bad hair cut at the last minute .
0 i was livid and called to complain .
0 they offered me nothing .
0 terrible customer service will never book with them again .
0 my experience did not live up to my expectations at all .
0 i could have gotten a better wax at a cheap nail salon .
0 my eyebrow still has n't grown back to its normal shape .
0 not worth your money !
0 i wo n't be going back to see him again .
0 this place is awful .
0 i mean , so so bad .
0 she rushed me into picking colors for my nails and toes .
0 water temp on the chair got too cold too fast .
0 absolutely horrible customer service .
0 not sure what star rating to give .
0 it 's happened everytime i go and it 's really unprofessional .
0 as for beverages , they really skimp .
0 despite the spa pricing this is not the spa treatment .
0 price was as i expected for a nice looking salon .
0 the bed was dirty too .
0 she was clearly in a hurry .
0 well what a mistake i made .
0 they booked me with a guy by the name of jason .
0 it cost me _num_ to get extensions so my hair looked thicker .
0 i can not recommend this salon .
0 ( $ _num_ for a hair cut i was n't satisfied with ) .
0 ok , so i really wanted to like this place .
0 that 's about as far as it goes though .
0 the haircut was $ _num_ .
0 they did n't wash my hair and the haircut took about _num_ minutes .
0 then , i went to go hang out with my best friend immediately after .
0 they charge me for their mistake .
0 but that 's apparently the way they do it .
0 the head massage was painful and rough .
0 i probably wo n't be returning for a hair appointment .
0 but i am not rushing back .
0 so disappointed with this place .
0 so disappointed with this place .
0 poor customer service and they were rude .
0 i am not a fan of this place .
0 please do not give them business .
0 you are better off going to another nearby dry cleaner .
0 first , they messed up one of our pants badly .
0 when i say they messed up one of our pants , they destroyed it .
0 rather , they were extremely rude and defensive .
0 for your own sake and peace of mind , do not give them business .
0 do not use this cleaner .
0 refused to replace them or compensate me for the loss .
0 they do not stand by their mistakes .
0 have been waiting for _num_ business shirts and suits for over _num_ weeks .
0 customer service is poor .
0 this place is extremely overrated .
0 the salmon was ok but not worth the $ _num_ either .
0 i 've been here a few times and have always been disappointed .
0 last night the service was especially lackluster .
0 the first time i went it was okay , but was very forgettable .
0 unfortunately , the food was mixed .
0 i had the chicken ramen soup for a main course .
0 it just was n't very good .
0 this includes the broth and the chicken .
0 as it is , i wish i 'd gone somewhere else .
0 dear pittsburgh , we are foodies from boston .
0 a restaurant like just should be nowhere near your top _num_ .
0 i would prefer to leave _num_ stars .
0 the pancakes were ok , a little mushy but flavorful .
0 i wish i could remember the other thing , but it was better .
0 when the bill comes , it is _num_ dollars .
0 and is _num_ dollars a glass .
0 drinking scotch in pittsburgh has been fun so far .
0 for appetizer , we had the kimchi pancakes , which were not fully cooked .
0 went to soba to celebrate my sons birthday .
0 quality of food was not at all what was expected for the price .
0 i wish they did n't put fried batter all over it though .
0 last i had the vegetarian curry dish , the only vegetarian main i found .
0 it was boring and not enough curry gravy with plain white rice !
0 the potatoes were also undercooked with not much flavor in the dish overall .
0 it was very cold .
0 everything took a long time to come out and the service was very poor .
0 needless to say i was extremely disappointed .
0 it was not enjoyable .
0 for the very first time the food was awful .
0 a pulled pork appetizer was passable , nowhere near the dish it replaced .
0 find a new chef quickly .
0 vietnamese beef noodles were bland and flavorless .
0 the menu lists them as including jalapeno , but there was no heat whatsoever .
0 thai corn soup jumbo crab ?
0 pad thai at a fusion place ?
0 tandoori salmon was average .
0 i still do n't understand why they served their fancy cream soda warm .
0 a cup given with no ice and a bottle of soda ?
0 why were n't their any ice in the glass ?
0 maybe it is really just me who prefer cold sodas .
0 show off how much money you can waste in a night .
0 after the renovation the place lost its center !
0 ... another one bites the dust !
0 the server went out of her way to make us feel uncomfortable .
0 no , we did not order any super fancy dishes .
0 lost _num_ stars for that .
0 the fish was tough and the other dish was simply inedible .
0 this place is far too expensive to be serving food poorly prepared .
0 way too much hype for such underwhelming food .
0 sadly , i was grossly disappointed .
0 it was nothing that would make me want to come back .
0 it was sad , really .
0 but it was downhill from there .
0 it was dry and average , at best .
0 it 's just not that good .
0 service is sketchy here at best .
0 first off , i can not comment on the food .
0 so , we were n't allowed to sit at the bar or a table .
0 those expectations kind of fell flat .
0 service here on a saturday night was atrocious .
0 it 's good , but too expensive .
0 i do n't think the price worth the food .
0 the portion is too small .
0 i mean really loud .
0 i have never placed a bad review of a restaurant until now .
0 i will not recommend this establishment in the future .
0 not planning to come back and recommend everyone to stay away from this place .
0 painfully mediocre : small rolls , $ _num_ miso soup , drinks were reasonable .
0 rolls small lacking substance .
0 however , i 'm in pittsburgh , where can i go ?
0 these place are virtually the same .
0 no ... these bagels are about the same you would get anywhere .
0 okay bagels though a little overpriced .
0 have consistently had rude customer service .
0 really turns me off .
0 wo n't be going back even though the bagels are okay .
0 i 'm not totally sure why i keep going back here .
0 it was super busy and only _num_ employees were making food .
0 the coffee 's terrible .
0 not worth the time and money to go here .
0 i go once or twice a week roughly , but never again .
0 but then again he knows everything is crap in his store .
0 it 's all crap .
0 do you like egg & bacon bagel sandwiches ?
0 they 'll cook the egg and bacon in their crap microwave for you .
0 tastes like crap but whatever , they serve it .
0 just like the butter and jelly packets sitting in the booth at denny 's .
0 but do n't feel this way .
0 the fellow who runs this crap store may be one .
0 was somewhat disappointed with my order from bagel factory today .
0 not horrible , just nothing to write home about .
0 i just found the worst breakfast spot in pittsburgh .
0 i 'm not kidding .
0 the egg and cheese were disgusting .
0 bad food - ordered a bagel sandwich - yuck !
0 and the customer service was horrible .
0 apparently the guy was the owner , but he was beyond rude .
0 the coffee was expensive and tasted like dirt .
0 avoid this place as all costs .
0 we also tried the hummus which was pretty good .
0 friends ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken salad .
0 they both said they were pretty good , if not a little dry .
0 then we had to wait _num_ minutes to get our bill .
0 she was not present for about _num_ minutes after we were sat .
0 she disappeared for about _num_ minutes before returning .
0 she served us our drinks then immediately left for another table .
0 she returned not long after and said she was alright .
0 i really could n't believe this .
0 this place is going downhill fast .
0 first off , our waitress just was n't good .
0 bacon does n't take that long to cook .
0 so , that was really disappointing .
0 but it was n't over .
0 there were literally exactly four sad little pieces .
0 only because i live nearby .
0 this place just bored me .
0 really do n't know what to say .
0 bored , bored , bored , bored , bored .
0 mmm not too happy with my recent experience at harris grill .
0 we ended up with our glasses 3/4 full and a watered down juice cocktail .
0 ours was n't plain and simple .
0 harris grill , i think your menu is trying too hard .
0 first place i went on my visit to pittsburgh .
0 i do n't really have a good review for this place .
0 it 's not even good bacon !
0 i have nothing good to say about this place .
0 waitstaff has a pretty poor knowledge of their own drink menu .
0 this place offers really poor service .
0 the waitstaff go out of their way to not help you .
0 we stopped going after we got some serious attitude from our waiter .
0 i do n't enjoy doing it .
0 almost every time i have been let down .
0 appetizers : nothing really wrong here .
0 $ _num_ for two fish tacos ?
0 i do n't hate anything on the harris grill menu .
0 sure , harris grill gets crowded , especially on the weekends .
0 no apologies , no offer to comp a side or a dessert .
0 bad form , harris grill .
0 but truth be told , i 'll probably be back .
0 because i really want to like harris grill .
0 the food is not incredible and the service is always mediocre at best .
0 i thought the selection on the menu was pretty poor .
0 then the waitress asked me if i knew the chicken itself was spicy .
0 the menu said nothing about that , so i had no idea .
0 zero stars for service .
0 zero stars for price .
0 once seated , service was extremely slow .
0 _num_ min from when seated . )
0 the place was mostly empty .
0 but again we watched table after table go empty and stay dirty .
0 and then the waitress only brought two of the three beverages .
0 the third took another _num_ minutes .
0 the menu was prix fixed at $ _num_ .
0 ( they had run out of home fries ) .
0 my eggs benedict was good , so was my bloody mary .
0 that said , i counted only _num_ dishes with any vegetables at all .
0 the coffee was disappointing -- it came with plastic cups of half & half .
0 was n't impressed by their sunday brunch .
0 did n't like the presentation of the buffet .
0 the salad was made with iceberg lettuce and did n't look appetizing .
0 in all , it 's really nothing special , just very basic .
0 there 're not much options on the menu .
0 i tried the pasta once and it was tasteless .
0 so i was in need of a lunch and off to the garden .
0 two grape size tomatoes , and two thin slices of cucumber .
0 i do n't understand why this place is so popular .
0 i 've been there _num_ times and each time the food was pretty gross .
0 the only option for brunch is to get the buffet .
0 they were packed and could n't keep enough food out .
0 and , insult to injury , my bloody mary was watered down .
0 very hit or miss place .
0 i will never go back to this place again !
0 it was calamari on top of some salad with thai chili sauce dressing .
0 it is just disgusting .
0 i stay _num_ blocks away from harris grill .
0 what turns me off a bit , it always seems dirty .
0 the bathroom smells , the menus seem filthy , but i like the food !
0 seemed cranky and overworked and ruined the experience completely .
0 salmon salad was not good at all .
0 will not be going back ever .
0 my _num_ star is as misleading as their drink menu .
0 we greeted her before she greeted us which i find rude .
0 she did not ask us anything when we were shopping .
0 she just sat there and read a magazine .
0 never , ever use these incompetent people for property management .
0 we 've had too many problems to list all of them .
0 we ca n't pay something if we do n't know how much to pay .
0 the equipment would often break down and never get fixed .
0 it was hard to find a machine .
0 the actual equipment is ok , but the locker rooms are pretty bad .
0 the reason you would stick to this gym is the classes .
0 parking is difficult to come by , and you have to pay .
0 there has to be better gyms in the area .
0 very disappointing and frustrating .
0 the gym also has barely any lighting .
0 its ridiculous and the policy needs to be changed asap .
0 update ... shadyside inn refunded the charges from our stay .
0 the building we stayed in was not full .
0 if i could give the place zero stars , i would .
0 great location but low on amenities .
0 `` it 's not coming off !
0 also most hotels offer no free parking , shadyside suites did .
0 the bedroom however seemed to dull car noise a little better .
0 hot water , not much of it low water pressure as well .
0 pros : it 's like living in an apt .
0 some of the staff has been friendly in providing things , including shuttle rides .
0 cons : extremely inconsistent room cleaning service !
0 the problem is , they do n't show on the assigned day to clean .
0 we stayed at the shadyside inn for months and spent thousands of dollars .
0 i really wanted to write a good review , but the experience was disappointing .
0 the quality of service from the staff was inconsistent .
0 and the elevator did not work at times .
0 we will not stay at this hotel again .
0 i 've never been so horribly treated in my life .
0 do not stay here .
0 nothing special about this place .
0 great location but the facilities are a little tired .
0 the management at this restaurant is horrendous .
0 i 've been here twice and i 'm just not crazy about it .
0 nothing is bad , per se , just not really impressive .
0 the big green salad was boring and everything was in huge chunks .
0 they have a hot vegetarian sandwich , but it sounds gross .
0 i would n't mind coming back for brunch .
0 she did n't rush us , and made good wine recommendations .
0 the burger was just a big slab of flavorless ground beef .
0 i could n't taste salt , pepper , garlic , anything .
0 their burgers are dead to me .
0 well , my update has half of my original rating .
0 i think she got _num_ out of every _num_ drink orders correct .
0 it was not crowded and we were seated and served promptly .
0 worst eggs benedict experience i 've ever had .
0 additionally , i was not too thrilled with the atmosphere or beer selection .
0 the fries were fairly soggy and otherwise par for the course .
0 so tired of this place .
0 i thought maybe the cook was having a bad night .
0 the balsamic vinaigrette was straight vinegar .
0 where do you find apples and feta cheese with no taste ?
0 butter served with the bread was so hard it bent the knife .
0 the bloody mary was completely disgusting .
0 and there was no alcohol in it .
0 it was god awful .
0 it was the same bagel , they just stuck it in the microwave .
0 had a pretty bad experience last time i went here .
0 the artichoke dip was ok , but very greasy .
0 the pasta a bit dry and bland as well .
0 there is an ok number of beers on tap .
0 the main courses are very low quality .
0 honestly , there were _num_ people in the restaurant .
0 my reuben sandwich was just okay .
0 probably should have gotten a salad .
0 i 'm hoping that i just caught them on a bad afternoon .
0 my lil heart fell .
0 i do n't know how this place has stayed in business for so long .
0 the menu is boring .
0 lettuce was ice cold , nearly frozen .
0 i hardly ever send food back or complain but this was really bad .
0 this place is hit or miss .
0 i 've had good meals here , and i 've had really bad ones .
0 there 's no pride in the service or the food at all .
0 sunny only offered a free cleaning and even then seemed annoyed .
0 could not have been more patronizing .
0 i would n't recommend richard or the salon to anyone .
0 the second haircut was great , but styled horribly .
0 the third haircut was just awful : styled awful , looked strange .
0 i went into dean of shadyside salon to get my hair colored .
0 the worst part was checking out .
0 are you kidding me ?
0 not pleased with all the hidden costs behind my hair color service .
0 wo n't be back .
0 this explains why i got my haircut there so many times .
0 each visit was more bizarre than the time before .
0 overall , my haircuts were never good .
0 and i might add , he knew i was sitting there waiting .
0 i was their with groupon and they gave me so bad service .
0 due to 3-4 hours of service i split it into two days .
0 the receptionist can not handle tips at all .
0 i left extremely upset and no one cared .
0 this is not an exaggeration .
0 i paid $ _num_ for a partial .
0 i think i 'll find a place that 's a little more ... me .
0 overall , haircut & style = _num_ stars .
0 the towel the girl put out had large brown stains on it !
0 mani = _num_ star .
0 the stylist did n't come back after a couple minutes .
0 when i asked the receptionist where the stylist was , she did n't know .
0 the next time i returned , i made an appointment with a different stylist .
0 they did n't even reschedule my appointment with another stylist when she did .
0 needless to say , i will not be back .
0 i 've tried to like dean 's several times over the years .
0 and each time i 've gone , my haircut has been ... .
0 but the overall vibe is weird and the service sucks .
0 the technique of the haircut is so poor .
0 i will not come for the second time .
0 the service was bad and unfortunately the haircut was even worse .
0 i tried dean 's because i had a coupon for a free hair cut .
0 he was very busy working on multiple people at the same time .
0 i was there for over _num_ hours !
0 richard does not make you feel comfortable .
0 i was not impressed with the atmosphere of the salons either .
0 - i will take my aunt to asians or school in north hills .
0 it was more than once that i heard glass breaking .
0 so i might not be the target audience .
0 the specials and menu prices are apparently wrong .
0 this is the worst lay out ever for a bar .
0 pricing is horrendous for beers .
0 weekend : dont bother .
0 i have never been treated so rudely by a waitstaff before in my life .
0 drink prices are n't anything special and cocktails are n't that strong .
0 went in there with friends knowing `` friends '' but everyone was rude .
0 unless you 're a local do n't go in there .
0 so i 'm not sure how much he 'd approve of this bar .
0 not a lot of character , but cheap prices .
0 needless to say , i will never come back here .
0 i use to pass by this place all the time .
0 this is a neighborhood denny 's with a bar .
0 at best , less than mediocre breakfast .
0 service was slow but they were nice about it .
0 ca n't comment on food since i was just in for beers .
0 crappy 's is more like it ... sorry i could not resist !
0 this place is very below average .
0 hot sauce was more difficult , took two requests before it came .
0 the food is basic and inexpensive , you get what you pay for .
0 so clearly lil off there ... other then that we order common breakfast .
0 further , they were unapologetic when i complained .
0 in my opinion , the is a prime example of a bad shadyside bar .
0 i 'd give this joint zero stars if it was possible .
0 this is the worst spot on walnut st !
0 i 'm not even sure where to start .
0 the vegetables were n't even cooked .
0 the food was terrible .
0 i would rather have eaten a mcdonald 's burger and fries .
0 overall terrible over priced food experience .
0 i would recommend never eating here .
0 so disappointed in food and its cost .
0 went for brunch and spent $ _num_ .
0 was there for over _num_ hours because service was so incredibly slow .
0 it was n't even super busy .
0 for _num_ girlfriends , they brought _num_ joint check .
0 then , they are n't even that nice !
0 rude , crowded , and most importantly not that great !
0 nothing stood out , including the famous burnt almond torte .
0 sorry , i grew up in pgh .
0 the filling in the middle had a bland taste , nothing special about it .
0 being a pastry chef myself , i had to try it .
0 i did like that the almonds stayed crispy even through shipping .
0 i ate one slice , and gave the rest away .
0 the almond torte used to be the best , hands down .
0 but , something happened sadly .
0 the cake part is now dry ?
0 go back to the way it was done before .
0 maybe i just got an old cake , i do n't know .
0 but i 'm really disappointed .
0 dirty and old looking bakery .
0 burnt almond torte is not as good as i expected .
0 not best cake in america by a long shot .
0 i 've experienced better '' ) because i have .
0 they were sold out at 2:00 pm on a thursday .
0 i was given a _num_ dollar gift card .
0 on top of that the cake was n't even fresh .
0 the chocolate was too sweet .
0 i have never been treated so poorly in a cafe .
0 the service was horrible and their coffee did n't taste great .
0 this place went from awesome to worst after it changed owners .
0 they used to have a white mocha but not anymore .
0 i miss the old owner of the place .
0 pamela is a bad representation of this location !
0 attitude and lack of hygiene is an issue for this `` employee . ''
0 they frequently mess up my friends orders when we go there .
0 the toppings on my salad were barely there .
0 the salad has been greatly reduced in size .
0 cutting too many corners .
0 i should have looked or felt it before i left the store .
0 ( all same kind of cookie ) .
0 apparently old cookies are standard here .
0 service is actually friendly , but slow , and all the employees are weird .
0 and the store is dirty , just as others have said .
0 avoid until this store gets its act together .
0 the district manager of this bakery to make sure it does not happen again .
0 that exchange was awkward too .
0 these people are very unprofessional and rude .
0 my main complaint with them is that they lied to me .
0 one of worst patient experiences .
0 his staff is embarrassed .
0 will not go back there , ever !
0 did n't havana go out of biz ?
0 if not , oops !
0 i only go in to buy six packs .
0 she was rude and all over the place .
0 hummus is ridiculously expensive .
0 every time we go here , we come out highly stressed , which sucks .
0 drama , drama , and more drama .
0 the entrance to this location always smells like spoiled milk .
0 not bad after hours but those hours are pretty narrow .
0 i woke up with a stuffy nose and in need of some hot soup .
0 this time it was runny bland mushy rice with extra mushy veggies .
0 plus i did n't feel great !
0 the small package was _num_ dollars .
0 selection of veggies are ok .
0 selection of fruit is a little below average .
0 however , lately i 'm becoming more and more frustrated by the store .
0 this is my third grocery store stop of the day .
0 for anyone who uses self checkout at this store do not forget your bags !
0 `` again i ask oh really is there nothing you can do ? ''
0 `` no i am sorry nothing we can do . ''
0 but going here is always such a nightmare .
0 the parking lot is miserable .
0 the aisles feel more narrow than they should be for a store this size .
0 the romaine is especially pitiful .
0 it 's come to the point that i avoid this place if i can .
0 i do n't care for this giant eagle , and that is being kind .
0 wo n't be back .
0 items do n't have price tags .
0 that 's the only reason why i gave them such a poor mark .
0 same goes for milk , cold cuts and breakfast meat products .
0 they also have fake sales .
0 instead of about _num_ '' _num_ '' it 's about _num_ '' thick .
0 i went there for a few grocery items along with some alcoholic beverages .
0 the only thing that saved this store were the nice people that worked there .
0 this giant eagle market district is garbage .
0 the cashiers , pharmacy , and customer service manager were so rude and stupid .
0 _num_ hours to find the cold remedy i wanted .
0 but why support a business that really does n't care about you .
0 the `` customer '' service and pharmacy are terrible at this location !
0 i checked out as quickly as possible and nearly ran out of the store .
0 after _num_ years i 'd hoped they would have improved but i was wrong .
0 i mean , i understand you do n't care about _num_ dollars .
0 i never really understood why doc 's was so popular .
0 i personally find its only real saving grace to be the outdoor deck .
0 the drinks are weak as well .
0 entrees were half off but all looked mediocre .
0 big groups of patrons led to pretty slow service .
0 the beer selection is n't that great and the upstairs bar is not full .
0 the service can also be rather slow .
0 cheese fries , burgers , some salads , mediocre pasta , etc .
0 my feet were still rough .
0 to be smooth after only one pedicure . ''
0 ignoring the fact that i was unhappy and i did n't like it .
0 she just kept trying to cover her ass instead of listening to my concerns .
0 the front desk girls were not friendly or helpful as well .
0 it 's an embarrassment on walnut .
0 if i wanted them in _num_ days i would have paid $ _num_ less !
0 no such luck , they said they were not able to do that .
0 and you just lost all of our business .
0 does n't even deserve one star !
0 however , the customer service here is absolutely awful .
0 tiffany prices with kay jewelers selection .
0 unfortunately within _num_ days one of the diamonds on the halo was missing .
0 i 'm sure that this is a fluke and will be taken care of .
0 however , this past visit was unfortunate .
0 the host was horrendous and extremely rude .
0 we mention our reservation , he says no problem _num_ min ... great !
0 okay , i know what you 're thinking why not just leave ?
0 i 've already admitted it 's nothing special .
0 but also way over prices .
0 service is bad when you enter .
0 if it is busy expect to be treated poorly .
0 that will be ignored and you will wait like everyone else .
0 the food is poor .
0 the pasta was mushy -- way overcooked .
0 far too much cream and cheese .
0 did n't finish this dish .
0 my wife had a chicken special .
0 although there were some highlights , there were plenty of negatives to counter them .
0 not a good start .
0 not a good start .
0 very poor form on the owners part .
0 but when the bill came there was none of that .
0 i then turned around and walked out .
0 i have never been treated so badly as a consumer .
0 actually i will make sure to spread the word of this terrible experience .
0 and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes .
0 this was the most absurd display at a restaurant i have ever seen .
0 food was excellent but we hated the ambiance !
0 reservations at 7:00 pm saturday .
0 i guess that 's what they say to excuse the lack of proper a/c .
0 that completely turned us away from this restaurant .
0 very rude and unacceptable .
0 ravioli , chicken breast , sauteed greens and a seasoned broth .
0 while the greens were decent , there were barely enough for a few bites .
0 we made the unfortunate decision to make a reservation here for a special occasion .
0 i wo n't be going here again .
0 luckily we had a fabulous dinner at another restaurant instead .
0 the owner has a complete disregard for customers and the customer experience .
0 we submitted our name thinking it would be 20-30 mins .
0 as tables became available he would seat groups that he knew and/or had reservations .
0 my friends had left this woman at least a _num_ % tip .
0 that is the prime reason why i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone .
0 the restaurant never called us , so we ended up eating elsewhere .
0 this time we literally got sat at a table in the kitchen hallway .
0 they should be serving free meals to anyone they stick at that table .
0 what a horrible experience !
0 it then took another _num_ minutes to get wine glasses .
0 this made everyone extremely uncomfortable !
0 the old guy continued to drink wine and yelled at another waitress .
0 so be aware they added an automatic _num_ % gratuity to the check .
0 life is too short to waste you time and money on this place !
0 they do n't know how to do business .
0 they do n't help you to find a table .
0 come for the food and not the atmosphere or service .
0 i made reservations for _num_ pm on a friday .
0 the waitress who seemed to be rushed did not offer any recommendations .
0 aside from the poor service and chaos , the food was pretty good .
0 also , i was surprised by the limited number of seafood options .
0 the menu states there are _num_ market priced items .
0 prices were not listed on that daily special menu sheet either .
0 as dinner was my treat , i felt very awkward asking for prices .
0 note that risotto , the only entree with a price , is $ _num_ .
0 the beef turns out to be $ _num_ .
0 i personally would not go back , even though the food was fantastic .
0 the owner gave that table to a local group who showed up after us .
0 basically , reservations mean nothing here .
0 even if the food is great , the customer service is terrible .
0 unfortunately , the party stops there .
0 the main courses are extremely overpriced ( not unusual for walnut st. ) .
0 apparently it was a list of people that needed to be seated .
0 my husband and i left and i said we would n't be coming back .
0 can not justify giving money to someone who runs their business in that manner .
0 really though someone had to have messed up my dish .
0 deserts were nothing less than stellar , and the service was awesome .
0 i was shocked by how bad our experience was considering the other reviews .
0 the food was decently made and the environment was welcoming .
0 she said it was salty but the pasta was bland .
0 she took my bottle of wine and did not mention the price or anything .
0 most restaurants charge per bottle , not per person .
0 i may or may not come back .
0 not off to a good start .
0 i will not be coming back .
0 decor leaves much to be desired .
0 fifteen minutes later , the waitress returned , but not with our food .
0 by this time , i was through with this place .
0 based on my experience , i wo n't be returning anytime soon .
0 i got the beef , the chicken & cilantro and the spinach empanadas .
0 do n't get me wrong , i wanted to like this place .
0 with all that said we tried all _num_ flavors of the empanadas they offered .
0 i ca n't even understand how people came to that conclusion .
0 the empty cup is still in front of me though .
0 i 've only gone because it is convenient to my location and reasonably priced .
0 i will never go back though .
0 not worth the hassle anymore & do a poor job .
0 way too expensive if you ask me .
0 it is such a rip off .
0 find someplace else in bloomfield .
0 is n't that why we bring clothes to the cleaners in the first place ?
0 they were returned to me a full size smaller than i dropped them off .
0 also they lost my fianc 's work shirts .
0 will not be returning .
0 it was returned with a hole in back of suit jacket .
0 sorry to say that will be my last visit .
0 if someone had been standing there , this would have caused serious injury .
0 i just ca n't imagine having to deal with this a year .
0 the minus : the maintenance staff is always around .
0 their staff is horribly rude that way .
0 thus , it makes me sad to write a negative review .
0 they are completely mean and disrespectful .
0 ps the maintenance staff are fabulous and deserve _num_ stars !
0 horrible in every sense of the word .
0 it took _num_ months for them to resolve this situation .
0 at one point , they even asked me not to use the shower .
0 a year later , the ceiling in my bedroom began to leak .
0 i used my apartment as essentially a storage unit until my lease expired .
0 i have never in my life seen anything like it .
0 they do n't c are .
0 they wo n't even bother to tell you that they will come !
0 not worth your money .
0 find a better management who does n't take your money and piss on you .
0 bathroom leaks atleast _num_ times a month .
0 very common problem in these apartments .
0 cant wait to move on .
0 the rent is too damn high .
0 if you sign a lease now it 's $ _num_ .
0 the hallways smell like hot garbage , always .
0 i was towed within _num_ hours after parking back there at ( 10pm ) .
0 ( no where on the contract does it state that ! )
0 bingo , could n't have said it better .
0 it is not worth it .
0 they just broke into my house without any notice to show around .
0 then , before i was able to say anything , they broke in .
0 i had no disclosure of this whatsoever when i signed my lease .
0 i do n't even understand how they have the time for this .
0 it 's absolutely disgusting , and you get no peace whatsoever .
0 now , i am stuck due to the heavy fees it would cost .
0 i 'm truly not out to get anyone with writing a negative review .
0 management did not even apologize for my inconvenience .
0 i thought this was way too much .
0 this was my big mistake .
0 , but instead they decided to take advantage of my position .
0 i do n't know .
0 they did not fix the building by the way .
0 also , my package was stolen twice .
0 they refuse to put a camera in the package room , parking lot too .
0 overall the rent keeps going up every year and their service just getting worse .
0 first of all , and the most important thing , they are not honest .
0 you pay fees , they make laundry and garbage more and more inconvenient .
0 elevator always has problems .
0 they do n't respect your privacy at all .
0 management said there was nothing they could do about it .
0 they 're all around rude to deal with .
0 wondered into this place looking for some mixed drinks .
0 but too much pamela 's seems greasy .
0 however , the pricing really is low when you 're lazy .
0 on top of it all , the coffee was horrible .
0 it looked like someone 's basement or garage with tables in it .
0 it 's like breakfast at most any other diner .
0 if you are dragged here by your friends , find new friends .
0 two words : grossly overrated .
0 unfortunately , pamela 's is neither of these things .
0 sadly , i walked away from my meal with a `` meh '' feeling .
0 first off , i kept hearing about these pancakes i got ta try .
0 they were super buttery ... too much so .
0 ca n't beat it .
0 we had a terrible breakfast here not long ago .
0 plus the bread was poor quality .
0 the crepe pancakes were ok , but nothing to write home about .
0 we 'll be enjoying breakfast elsewhere in the future .
0 for pamela 's , we gave it a shot .
0 the restaurant was fairly busy with lots of customers chatting at their tables .
0 way too rich to finish .
0 not deserving of the rave reviews .
0 breakfast is cheap , and definitely very poor quality .
0 the waitresses were extremely fast , except for coffee refills .
0 that is a huge turn off , especially if you are out of town .
0 this place is n't worth going to an atm for .
0 they are super thin and crispy on the outside .
0 i also did n't love the service we received .
0 there are a few of them and there 's really nowhere else to go .
0 this was just a joke and definitely not worth the wait .
0 we went on a sunday and i expected a wait , which was fine .
0 they were busy , but our waitress was slightly cold and barely around .
0 this was one of the most disappointing food experiences i 've had in pittsburgh .
0 it was average , but not restaurant quality .
0 the only thing that made it somewhat decent was sour cream and guacamole .
0 i ate about _num_ bites and left the rest .
0 it was n't worth even trying to eat for absolutely zero taste .
0 needless to say , we wo n't be going back for quite some time !
0 and , most sadly , the cup of coffee was weak .
0 not keeping with the the _num_ star yelp review that brought us here .
0 done in less than _num_ hours .
0 come now , i barely drink alcohol .
0 granted , i like to host social events .
0 however , i never ever will let a social event get out of control .
0 so here comes the story of walnut capital .
0 they complained that our house was not clean and scared off the potential tenants .
0 but we never let the house get to a point of disaster .
0 we always took the trash out .
0 never again will i rent from this company .
0 - chuck the driver for the shuttle is cool .
0 under no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order .
0 so , my wife got up and we walked out of this place .
0 in fact , i did n't eat anything at all .
0 the restaurant is located in the basement of a building off of walnut street .
0 first , there are n't many tables .
0 my party and i left to go to another restaurant .
0 however , the crepes are extremely over price .
0 so over price that i can not afford a drink .
0 i 've chosen never to eat here again due to the staff .
0 the savory crepes were better than the sweet crepes which were a disappointment .
0 but it was the attitude of the owner that turned me off the establishment .
0 we were in a hurry because of limited visiting hours .
0 the prices on the menu do n't seem that bad .
0 but i still cant get over the fact there closed on mondays .
0 that aside , the crepes are okay , nothing special .
0 the other thing i do not like about this place are their hours .
0 i looked at my boyfriend who checked his watch while i checked my iphone .
0 otherwise , negative stars would be in effect .
0 who on earth could possibly find this place worth returning to ?
0 what a completely miserable experience .
0 even the orange juice was bad .
0 the response and reaction that i got from her receptionist was quite rude .
0 i made an appointment weeks ago .
0 i said i could n't .
0 they refuse to put anything on paper .
0 every thing about this place is wrong .
0 i should not be responsible for the bill .
0 they did not explain this to me when i register .
0 this place is the worst ever .
0 when we arrived there , however it was a different story .
0 we shrugged it off and went to the bar .
0 terrible service that night from an otherwise reputable place .
0 just getting off work , i came alone .
0 the walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass .
0 neither of us were surprised .
0 the food handling left much to be desired .
0 this was sorely lacking .
0 first thing i realized is that there 's no bathroom in the room .
0 since we were staying one night , this was a major disappointment .
0 the wedding manager nicole is ok , but nothing special .
0 it is clear that this is not her main priority .
0 not professional at all .
0 not a huge deal , but annoying since we asked them to do that .
0 unfortunately , it appears to be very poorly managed .
0 they were not met here .
0 that is not what you want to hear first thing in the morning !
0 there were no pictures hung in the room to improve the appearance .
0 the costumer service really ruined my experience .
0 awful customer service , rude and poorly managed .
0 it was not even $ _num_ including se day shipping !
0 the location also seemed a bit sketchy ; i 'd avoid this one .
0 try panera bread across the street .
0 we ai n't got no hashbrowns !
0 employees show no sense of urgency .
0 if any of the employees would smile i would die from shock .
0 do they train them to be rude and ignorant ?
0 do n't use the drive-thru .
0 but i quickly learned my lesson .
0 i got tired of spending _num_ minutes of my lunch break waiting in line .
0 no less than _num_ minutes .
0 the drive-thru is only slightly faster at 10-15 mins .
0 plus , the staff is rude .
0 big corporate america places only get one shot w us .
0 worst wait times ever , staff is inefficient .
0 the drive thru line is always too long and moves too slowly .
0 also , the service is slow and poor .
0 worst wendy 's i have ever had .
0 i suppose , then , i should n't have been surprised by the food .
0 my moo shu chicken was mostly cabbage .
0 the food here was greasy , uninspired and bland .
0 i was also disappointed that they do n't serve brown rice .
0 not to be recommended unless you 're desperate .
0 i had to throw it in the microwave because it was no longer hot .
0 and they gave us some disgusting mustard sauce to dip it in . )
0 we used to visit this place most every time we went to pittsburgh .
0 the food is n't terrible , either , but it 's not great .
0 oh , and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all .
0 dim lighting that makes me want to sleep .
0 it 's not romantic , just dim .
0 the only waitress i 've had there is pretty rude .
0 my minimum tip is $ _num_ , even at the cheapest places .
0 the food is only okay .
0 i am never going to order their general tso ever again .
0 price is not bad .
0 why is it so hard to find a good chinese restaurant in pittsburgh ?
0 not all her fault .
0 not bad , a little tasteless , but why bother ?
0 nor good signs and we should have walked out then .
0 the worst chinese food i 've had .
0 there were bugs in my egg drop soup .
0 i ordered two orders of soup hot and sour and egg drop .
0 i only eat the hot and sour the night we ordered our take out .
0 looked like a bunch of fruit flies made their way into the soup .
0 the wonton soup was watery , and the wontons were inedible .
0 not very good chinese food here .
0 it reminded me of a cheap college place .
0 they give you plenty of food but it is low quality .
0 the rice tasted like a flavorless mush with chewy `` pork '' .
0 it tasted nothing like pork , or meat for that matter .
0 the soup was a weird creamy mess .
0 cardboard with a strange tangy sauce and a side of disaster .
0 it was just awful and the service was terrible .
0 i looked around and there were only _num_ other people in the entire restaurant .
0 is n't that what they 're supposed to do ?
0 anyway , the food was not very good .
0 in fact , it was awful .
0 i 'm not sure they were .
0 there 's never any reason to be rude to your patrons .
0 no need to ever return .
0 after an hour of waiting , i called to check on our order .
0 i asked if it was out for delivery and she could n't tell me .
0 she could n't tell me how much longer we would wait .
0 the delivery driver arrived about _num_ minutes later .
0 crappy service and food .
0 could not eat it .
0 waiter clearly did not know what he was talking about .
0 there are better chinese places on pittsburgh - this place should be shut down !
0 there is nothing chinese about the food !
0 general tso chicken lacks in chicken .
0 our food was cold .
0 i spent $ _num_ and only ate the fortune cookie .
0 did n't know you could mess up chicken lo mein .
0 delivery came somewhat cold , extremely bland .
0 the service provided by a chinese man was terrible !
0 and the food was terrible too !
0 worst chinese food ever .
0 it 's either just decent , or just plain bad .
0 i 'm still trying to figure out how one manages to burn noodles .
0 this place is disgusting .
0 worst chinese food i 've ever had .
0 it tasted rotten and disgusting .
0 i picked out the broccoli and ate it over my side of rice .
0 worst chinese food i 've had in ages .
0 we ordered just soup and eggrolls for takeout .
0 the worst ever chinese restaurant if we can call this place as restaurant !
0 future actions : will not come again for sure !
0 at this point , one star is being generous .
0 after a noticeable drop in quality , i started ordering elsewhere .
0 my girlfriend ordered sesame chicken and it tasted like fish .
0 i had chicken and broccoli with limp foul tasting broccoli .
0 unfortunately , we threw out most of our entrees .
0 i will not be ordering here ever again .
0 i think people should know how awful this place is before stepping inside .
0 _num_ woman in the store were very helpful and knowledgable .
0 i have n't received my piece yet and its been about _num_ days .
0 everything else was of unremarkable to poor quality .
0 too pricey for the quality .
0 while it has a somewhat trendy looking menu , do n't be fooled .
0 while the onion soup was actually good , the rest was awful .
0 crab cakes were awful .
0 worse than eat park quality .
0 just said to try back again !
0 salads , sandwiches , burgers and entrees we have all had before .
0 i had the walnut crusted salmon sandwich and jordan had the reuben .
0 french fries are pretty standard .
0 the food is lousy .
0 what a disappointment - i wo n't be back .
0 the service in this store is ridiculous .
0 why could n't they take a couple minutes and wrap our gift for us ?
0 i was so confused and annoyed that i just left after paying .
0 they just are n't nice .
0 the manager wears face earrings , how very unprofessional .
0 sure she knew that rude .
0 the place is dirty too .
0 delivery time was unimpressive .
0 that 's what i get for being lazy , probably .
0 otherwise , probably not .
0 man were they wrong !
0 we ordered a large steak stromboli with extra cheese through grub hub .
0 not even worth a star .
0 the hot wings i ordered came as plain breaded wings .
0 it was one of the worst pizzas i 've ever had .
0 first of all , the pie had almost no real flavor .
0 the dough , sauce , cheese ... even the pepperoni was bland .
0 i put some hot sauce on it strictly to add flavor .
0 on top of it , i got so sick .
0 my stomach was in knots for hours .
0 very cheap over breaded and not fresh at all .
0 the good : the ladies who run the registers are personable and helpful .
0 if it were n't so convenient i doubt i 'd go back .
0 my big issue is that the employees stand directly outside and smoke .
0 i get the location is close but it is not worth the grief .
0 i called two more times after this with no call back .
0 i would n't recommend going here .
0 there were _num_ customers ahead of me and _num_ ladies behind the counter .
0 i also plan to tell my family and friends not to shop here .
0 extremely rude lady works there on sundays .
0 the worst bakery i ever shopped in !
0 if given the chance again i would n't have another party here .
0 very cold to watch a game in even buy usual local rink standards .
0 made the same mistake 2x by going to these clowns .
0 could n't even call me to let me know .
0 drove down there so they could say sorry want to do it tomorrow ?
0 they 'll try to hit you with a bunch of unnecessary repairs .
0 do n't waste your time with this place .
0 just this last episode that has to deal with an inspection has me annoyed !
0 i have driven _num_ miles in the car since beginning of september .
0 so after explaining the situation they lower the price to $ _num_ .
0 not a bad place to look around while waiting for your order .
0 _num_ which seems to be a never ending construction zone .
0 the pizza was really greasy , and the bacon was minimal .
0 worst nail salon ever .
0 not a smart move on my part .
0 the place was totally dusty and there was no ac .
0 i just kinda stared at her in shock , unable to speak .
0 it was just a bad scene .
0 it 'll never dry !
0 i would absolutely not return to this salon .
0 this made me question whether or not she was professionally trained .
0 what a complete waste .
0 i had a mani pedi today and they were brutal ... .
0 the owner was sitting right there and did n't do anything or say anything .
0 please know that i hate leaving bad reviews .
0 and the pedicure was really really painful !
0 i would like to stress again though that my feet look awesome .
0 but i left stressed and bleeding !
0 i do n't know whats worse , terrible service or this filthy venue .
0 no wonder it is for sale .
0 do not get married here !
0 i would not suggest this bar to anyone .
0 we went here for easter buffet and the money it was not worth it .
0 the food was tasteless , place looked dirty , and rude waitress .
0 this place seems to have gone downhill since last time .
0 sorry , i gotten very used to no smoking i public places in pittsburgh .
0 ash trays all over the bar .
0 if i could give signature desserts _num_ stars , i would .
0 linda did not call .
0 this was the worst experience i ever had with business owners !
0 nothing was the way i ordered it !
0 i ca n't even begin to tell you how they treated me !
0 steve and linda were so rude and unprofessional !
0 just called to get information for my son 's birthday cake .
0 either way , no need for rudeness .
0 i bought pastries at this place several times before .
0 this place is run by korean women who are interested in providing extra services .
0 $ _num_ wasted because i never got my massage .
0 avoid this place unless you are looking for the happy ending .
0 had n't been here for several years , horrible disappointment .
0 egg rolls , wonton soup were not good .
0 i visited here at 6:30 p.m. on a saturday night .
0 there are about _num_ seating options , _num_ were used all the others empty .
0 first sign i chose to ignore .
0 nothing updated , nothing new , nothing fresh .
0 second sign i chose to ignore .
0 he was loud , very loud .
0 he was not asian .
0 white , and very loud .
0 there was no asian table or house workers in the front side of things .
0 third sign i chose to ignore .
0 nothing special in flavor or presentation .
0 perhaps leftovers from the _num_ steakhouse sale .
0 i sent all the food back shortly into the meal because it was cold .
0 when was the last time you ate chinese food that was cold ?
0 it 's never cold , never .
0 the salesperson walked away and proceed to start helping other customers .
0 after waiting for 5-10 minutes , she went back to the sales person .

0 i was disappointed with the selection of food as well .
0 my husband let me try a bite of his rueben which was really good .
0 first off , the beer menu .
0 ultimately , i was n't very impressed .
0 i just did n't want to create a scene in front of my guest .
0 i was expecting something stellar , and i feel rather let down .
0 this stuff looked and tasted more like doughy noodles .

0 the wait staff is slow and management has no clue .
0 but rather good could n't complain .
0 the only good thing was that the cheese biscuits here are bomb !
0 everything else is a joke .
0 i 'm not big on chain restaurants .
0 not because the food is bad but because i like to try new places .
0 i see why this restaurant is rated so poorly .
0 the clientele , for some reason , really made for a loud dining experience .
0 our waitress was hit or miss and we waited awhile for the bill .
0 would not visit again .
0 worst service i have ever had .
0 the waitress the first time i went was a little short , not personable .
0 the second time about 2-3 months later was just awful .
0 i was there on a weeknight , for over _num_ hours .
0 i just do n't even know what to say .
0 it made my whole experience disappointing .
0 i wo n't go back to this location .
0 our salad and bread came out with our food which was a little irritating .
0 he was great but everything else was extremely slow .
0 i really ca n't imagine what could be making it so slow here .
0 just got back from dinner which took over _num_ hrs .
0 i hate to blame the kitchen , but i think it 's the kitchen .
0 plus my caesar salad had slimy wilted lettuce .
0 food was mediocre as well .
0 wo n't be coming back .
0 boxes and toys were all over the floor in the store .
0 the store needs a major overhaul and some employees who care .
0 the message to me is management must be blind & ignorant .
0 the store would not cash out the remaining balance on the gift cards .
0 this place sucks big time as far as cleanliness and order .
0 are they going out of business ?
0 i made a very simple order online -- very difficult to screw up .
0 the sub was not one bit better than subway .
0 this was a complete waste of my time and money .
0 my bill : $ _num_ .
0 the to-go process makes me want to bang my head against a wall tho .
0 um no , its like $ _num_ extra for delivery .
0 my advice is anyone picking up a to-go order is to do the same .
0 the restaurant was clean and the people working were friendly .
0 wo n't visit again .
0 waiting in line took roughly _num_ minutes on a tuesday about _num_ noon .
0 i asked for an estimated wait time , not how many appointments there are .
0 bad business practices are very disappointing .
0 that is not a way to earn anyone 's business !
0 just gon na stand here and get looked over for a little while longer .
0 decent furniture but wow was i disappointed by the payment process .
0 why is n't this practice illegal ?
0 it 's sad to experience systems that work so obviously against the customer .
0 he just put it on the bill .
0 worst customer service ever !
0 ashley furniture will get my business from now on .
0 at first they said they are unable to do so .
0 the quality of the furniture turned out to be very poor .
0 the store told them that they have problems with that manufacturer all the .
0 to date the store has done nothing to replace the defective furniture .
0 the worst customer service ever !
0 they already had my money , so why be courteous now ?
0 that 's is bad business !
0 she was super excited and counting down the days until arrival .
0 they have completely horrible , rude customer service reps .
0 tried to call corporate and let 's just say they could care less .
0 thinking back and forth on it did n't seem right .
0 i was ok with this and it sounded fair enough .
0 well i went there on january _num_ to return my mattress .
0 did not want to buy another mattress online .
0 most places allow return of items within _num_ days , even if a mattress .
0 this is by far the absolute worst furniture experience i have encountered .
0 the sales lady made an annoying appearance every ten minutes .
0 at this point , my patience are very thin .
0 i mean really , this is ridiculous .
0 my god the sun will be coming up soon !
0 the main waiting area is also empty .
0 they next wanted to try my hands and i refused .
0 i will never have another mri done there .
0 the baby starts coming out : doctors runs in my room .
0 if you have an emergency do not come here .
0 go here to die !
0 i went here after a car accident that was not my fault .
0 and i felt like total crap the whole next day at work .
0 they gave me my cast and i left at _num_ .
0 i can not be refunded and the bill will be sent .
0 self checkout is the only option and is a joke .
0 employees would much rather carry inappropriate conversations for the work place than assist .
0 sorry wo n't be back !
0 if no stars could be given that would be more accurate .
0 this store , however , is definitely lacking in customer service .
0 no way , no how .
0 we left , went to the charlotte store and they were amazing .
0 i called back at 10am instead .
0 some rude nasty woman answers the phone !
0 next time your country ass needs to stay home from work .
0 the person checking me out was not hospitable .
0 went here and of course had the worst experience getting my bridesmaid dress .
0 stick to a boutique if you want real customer service .
0 she did n't say a word to us .
0 they had _num_ opportunities to assist us with the process and ignored us .
0 they could n't find it in the `` on holds area '' wth ?
0 we felt bad , and stuck around .
0 there is _num_ minutes left to pick and try on dresses !
0 a very frustrating moment indeed .
0 the other staff were horrible !
0 another lost sale opportunity .
0 they lost out big time with me .
0 i open the bag where my dress was and i was so dissapointed .
0 my problem is with the alterations department .
0 they also rushed me during my final fitting .
0 very rude and unprofessional , do n't go there !
0 brandy was the worst .
0 if she 's the best , i would hate to see the worst .
0 do not get your alterations done at this location !
0 they charge at least $ _num_ more for bridesmaids alteration of a short dress .
0 the hem was n't even touched and they charged me $ _num_ .
0 this whole department is insane .
0 glad this is all over .
0 this store is not customer service friendly .
0 that should have been my first clue to walk away .
0 so i asked how to return it and he did n't know .
0 my real complaint is just how rudely we were treated at both locations .
0 worst service i 've had in a long time .
0 it was just me and my mom and i just wanted to browse .
0 so that was weird .
0 what a horrible experience !
0 i also came in many times before and the employees never helped me .
0 they were just sitting down doing nothing .
0 i am definitely disappointed .
0 i would n't even give them one star at this location !
0 this was the worst service and experience i have ever received !
0 the ladies at the reception desk are horrible !
0 i called to order contacts and they were utterly confused .
0 terrible place and i would not recommend this facility to anyone .
0 i said to myself , this is unsanitary practices being used here .
0 i asked for a full refund , i was not spending my money here .
0 this restaurant is so gross and it 's dirty .
0 but this location puts the name to shame .
0 are you kidding me - not even inspected prior to delivery .
0 poor attention to detail , poor quality .
0 the guy was obviously knowledgable about mattresses but he was rude and condescending .
0 tried to pressure me into buying a bed right then and there .
0 neither of us were impressed .
0 so if this was based on food i would give buca a _num_ .
0 two and a half stars , neither a-ok nor real bad .
0 the lunch portion was huge , too much in fact .
0 service was absolutely dismal for no good reason .
0 it was neither busy nor a late hour for lunch .
0 it was loud and crowded .
0 needless to say ... i will never go there again !
0 every time we have eaten here , we were hungry shortly after .
0 very dim lighting somewhere between romantic and creepy .
0 it is a little overpriced even with coupons for the quality of food .
0 at least with this experience , did not have the best server .
0 he did not seem to be too enthusiastic with his job .
0 no hurry to go back there ... ever .
0 i do n't know if i can ever return to buca .
0 firstly , i knew there was something wrong with the server when we arrived .
0 she just seemed ... off ... or high .
0 ok , i did , and i stopped eating .
0 there is nothing worse than someone else 's hair in your food .
0 so , i kept quiet against my better judgement .
0 i just started laughing , i was sure this entire night was a joke .
0 holy ... cannoli ... get me out of here !
0 sorry buca , a previous visit was much better than this one .
0 you really seem to care about this restaurant 's reputation .
0 he said they 're making improvements and that i should try it again .
0 i was n't as impressed with buca as i wanted to be .
0 the only thing mixed about this salad was the iceberg and red cabbage .
0 it was just okay as a whole .
0 for our main dish , we got the large order of spicy chicken rigatoni .
0 it just was n't as authentic as i was hoping for .
0 they had _num_ hostess up front doing nothing and did n't even greet us .
0 why would you even try to seat us like that ?
0 reason i book reservation is to have enough seats ahead of time .
0 she gave me an attitude .
0 terrible customer service and it was my birthday .
0 will never return to the restaurant .
0 worst italian food ever !
0 they should n't even call it italian food .
0 the bread was even bad .
0 do n't waste your time and money going here .
0 i was less than impressed .
0 the meatballs were greasy and very bland .
0 the price was extremely high for food that was bland and not impressive .
0 seriously , how many f words can you not use on a yelp review ?
0 salad came first then bruschetta ( wtf ) toast and tomatoes and cheese .
0 came out fast , but entre 's came out _num_ mins later .
0 it was n't bad , just nothing great .
0 its like the place tries too hard .
0 as if the food is not the real star of the show .
0 my server lost me towards the end .
0 instead it 's a runny broth at the bottom of the bowl .
0 once again we leave this place unhappy and dissatisfied .
0 this food is just crap .
0 i made sure i asked for extra sauce ( just in case ) .
0 needless to say i was disappointed again !
0 it was also barely cooked , not crispy at all .
0 the fist time after a _num_ minute wait , they brought the wrong food .
0 they gave us a $ _num_ gift card to make up for it .
0 never had problem at other locations .
0 will not return at this location !
0 mama ricotta will be a better option .
0 management very rude and customer service is very poor .
0 yes , that 's not long , but it 's definitely boring .
0 i do n't like this place , nor the food .
0 strange odor - musty old smell .
0 other table was trying to check out and the bartender and manager ( ? )
0 but a $ _num_ dinner for _num_ i expect more .
0 birthday celebration & dessert is n't free ?
0 service was sub par at best .
0 last nights visit to buca was less than i expect from this restaurant .
0 the service was awful .
0 we were very disappointed .
0 $ _num_ bill for four -- sorry i expect much better service !
0 the drinks and salads are also soooo pricey .
0 the visit i am reviewing was for take-out .
0 nearly _num_ minutes after that time , my order was still not ready .
0 it appears this location has a serious management issue .
0 it more than less ruined our dining experience .
0 this was a very disappointing dining experience .
0 we ordered _num_ family portions of _num_ different dishes .
0 the spaghetti and meatballs were very bland .
0 the only dish we liked was the chicken dish .
0 completely ruined our meal .
0 so this past friday i held a birthday dinner for my mother here .
0 things quickly got off to a bad start .
0 the staff would not know i had once asked for that room .
0 however , i will never return to this place .
0 ok italian food , portions are big , but you pay for them .
0 service was ok , birthday dessert was a bowl of whipped cream .
0 when i walked in and looked over the menu i too was excited .
0 unfortunately the food did not come close to my expectations .
0 baked ziti is supposed to have a lot of cheese and sauce .
0 is n't that what baked ziti is ?
0 and the veal was dry .
0 not good customer service .
0 unless you have no other choice do not shop here .
0 the store is horribly dirty and the prices are higher then harris teeter .
0 this place sucks the cashiers are either very rude , slow and incompetent .
0 unfortunately , the service is some of the worst i 've experienced in charlotte .
0 they all looked at me , none greeted or walked toward me .
0 none of the three ever tried to assist .
0 false advertising on patio furniture .
0 overall , the look of the store just seems to be tired .
0 never will be coming back here again .
0 worst customer service ever !
0 seriously i waited in the drive thru for like _num_ minutes .
0 ( i was _num_ cars away ) .
0 i 'm stuck between two and three stars .
0 after all it is taco bell .
0 you can usually count on them for cheap and fast food .
0 the cheap part is always standard .
0 but , the fast part for this location has struggled for a while .
0 although , i do really have zero complaints on the food .
0 after all it is taco bell .
0 excuse given was understaffed but when you are not busy it does n't fly .
0 despite the cost of the set we had to pay $ _num_ for delivery .
0 or , they can pick-up the entire set and provide _num_ % credit .
0 no consideration to the value of our time .
0 the hostess was very short with me and my date .
0 no personality and did n't make us feel welcome .
0 no personality , still .
0 my date did n't like her steak either .
0 things have really slipped since then though .
0 they drowned my salad in ranch dressing and cheese ... .
0 my soup was alright - french onion - pretty standard .
0 we like longhorn , but not this location .
0 the service here is mediocre at best .
0 when we eventually got the appetizer the bread , there were no plates around .
0 _num_ more minutes to get plates .
0 my caesar salad was sour and otherwise bland .
0 worst experience in a long time .
0 our waitress did not seem very enthusiastic .
0 the only employee i could see in the entire restaurant was the bartender !
0 from the other reviews it seems i did n't miss anything .
0 this used to be my favorite steak house in charlotte .
0 it 's really gone downhill lately .
0 the last _num_ times i 've eaten here the prime rib was still cold .
0 he brought it back still cold .
0 they get two for the great service but everything else was not so good .
0 her corn on the cob was undercooked .
0 we will not be coming back again .
0 probably why ... carlos the manager is cheap and not customer friendly !
0 our server jeff was the worst waitstaff i 've encountered in many years .
0 that he did n't know there was a problem ?
0 that he had been there _num_ months and never had a complaint ?
0 i wish i would have taken a picture .
0 i could n't believe they tried to pass that off as a steak .
0 it 's not a very good longhorn .
0 my hubby ordered coffee , cobb salad and filet .
0 his salad had no issues so all in all it was what we expected .
0 our expectations were not too high and the restaurant delivered just that .
0 i would not recommend going to this best buy location .
0 then customer service wouldnt help me .
0 after waiting another five to ten minutes someone finally came .
0 no thank you or thanks for you patience .
0 he put the tv in my truck turned around and walked away .
0 absolutely horrible customer service !
0 the worst best buy i have ever visited .
0 back and forth a total waste of time .
0 then the manager told me we would not have sold one in the condition .
0 but they sure sold it to me .
0 only _num_ people in line when arrived .
0 _num_ minutes later _num_ people still in line .
0 horrible is the word .
0 horrible business practice here .
0 do not shop at best buy .
0 they 'll gladly take your money , however , good luck getting issues resolved .
0 there was a long line and only one employee at the checkout .
0 they have no clue what the word `` toasted '' means .
0 the lox bagels are not even made open face .
0 not going back again .
0 i got back to my office and the bagel was not toasted .
0 not the best or the worst mall in charlotte .
0 they would n't even give us a couple minutes to settle our child down .
0 i will not be back to see year people again !
0 gave this mall yet another try again today , disappointed again .
0 all the regular stores , plus some of the more trashy ones .
0 which on the mall alone would be _num_ star !
0 this was the worst customer service i have encountered in awhile .
0 i went to exchange a product , instead i just returned .
0 i chose the fiesta chicken chopped salad and new chicken tortilla soup .
0 the chicken tortilla soup was just ok .
0 overall , the experience was horrible .
0 the service was horrible .
0 so if you 're coming to drink ... not so bad .
0 if you 're coming to eat ... ah you might think again !
0 yes i know sometimes things could land i 'm my food .
0 she then went to get our drinks .
0 very visible and inappropriate .
0 i wish i could give a no star review for this location .
0 the only bright spot was the waitress .
0 the runny quinoa was a mess and hard to boot .
0 the pasta at applebee 's are definitely not worth the $ _num_ they charge .
0 the portions are way too small and not good at all .
0 we went here with family to have lunch , the service was ok .
0 that was not to be found here .
0 please do not use this location .
0 they do not take responsibility for their mistakes .
0 it 's a shame , because it was a beautiful gift .
0 do not do business with these people .
0 shortly after , another lady comes over .
0 clearly , i was never meant to know the price of this ring .
0 the same style etc , just a different ring that fit .
0 just a bit uncomfortable to see how much someone spent on an engagement ring !
0 i was very unimpressed with this olive garden location .
0 secondly , the kitchen is one of the worst in the entire company .
0 anyways , horrible experience .
0 the table they sat us at , smelled so badly !
0 i did not even want to put my purse down .
0 this made my food experience not good .
0 the place is just older and needs some renovations .
0 the place is not clean , the table we sat was sticky .
0 the deal also comes with either a small app or a dessert to share .
0 the spicy sausage soup she first ordered was mostly broth .
0 want a zero star option !
0 i am a fan of olive garden but this one is horrible !
0 ended up with _num_ meals un eaten .
0 we got there around _num_ and had no wait for a table .
0 breadsticks and salad came out like expected .
0 the breadsticks are alway delish and hard to turn away eating more .
0 he ate it and did n't complain ... .
0 this is probably one of the worst olive garden i have been to .
0 my server was horrific .
0 i am completely disappointed .
0 she and i were both a little nervous about getting poor service .
0 he said , `` no , absolutely not .
0 throughout the entire order , we got nothing but attitude .
0 but the rest of the place , not so much .
0 could someone have asked us if we wanted a drink ?
0 otherwise , it would have been pretty good .
0 i know , i know -- olive garden , how pedestrian of me !
0 when we sat down , i was immediately hit by a gross smell .
0 it smelled badly like wet dog .
0 the bread sticks were pretty underwhelming -- there was no garlic or flavor really .
0 they served salad shortly my goodness this place was slow though .
0 when it came out , it was pretty lousy .
0 i 'd stay away from this garden like the plague , though .
0 i feel like the food is not flavorful and are always missing something .
0 this place was disgusting !
0 the food was gross , greasy and very bad .
0 i gave it one star because of the waiter .
0 smells like wet dog .
0 service was very bad today .
0 delivered our desert in a to go container without us even asking !
0 the service however , left much to be desired .
0 our server was obviously having a bad night .
0 it took almost _num_ minutes to get our salad .
0 at that point our drinks were empty .
0 service is very bad .
0 waitress was throwing plates on the table .
0 have been to many restaurants but this was my worst experience .
0 wow , only in charlotte would you find a chain restaurant bar crawl .
0 it 's og though , so neither were anything spectacular .
0 it saved me from cooking and doing dishes though .
0 we wo n't be stopping back to celebrate at this location again .
0 food came slow and was cold .
0 but the reason i went was to try the lobster raviolis .
0 there i was very disappointed .
0 shrimp on top was nice but no lobster filling .
0 i just remembered why i do n't visit chain sit down restaurants .
0 i 'm glad there was more mango than strawberry .
0 the strawberry was too sweet .
0 by far the worst service we 've had in a while .
0 i am a big fan of olive garden but not this one .
0 a refill was never offered .
0 the salad was swimming in dressing where normally the dressing is light .
0 it was totally different from all other og restaurants i 've visited .
0 i doubt that i 'll ever go back to this location again .
0 no one was at the door to greet me .
0 i had to walk around the whole restaurant to find my husband .
0 what a terrible manager !
0 i see the server standing right there with no response .
0 slow service and a mediocre meal .
0 for example , at my most recent visit i ordered the steak gorgonzola alfredo .
0 the steak was supposed to be medium ; instead it came well done .
0 ( that might also explain the meat being overdone ) .
0 i do n't like chains a lot , but some i tolerate .
0 it 's noisy , crowded , disorganized , and there are not enough waiters .
0 so far really slow food service .
0 okay , but wo n't be going back soon .
0 saturday was my first time back and i was dissapointed in the changes .
0 otherwise i would have brought him with me and we could have dined in !
0 really made me sad .
0 its not like she got nothing out of it !
0 the fries were bad .
0 not crispy but chewy and not very salty .
0 does n't seem like good customer service .
0 never again will i deal with these useless morons .
0 this was a no go for me .
0 i went and told carmax and they said ford was lying .
0 _num_ hour later it was completed .
0 they tried to charge me $ _num_ for _num_ hours of labor .
0 they then corrected it and charged me a flat fee of $ _num_ .
0 if this is their generic price for _num_ hour of labor it is ridiculous .
0 it should n't have take an hour to do it anyway .
0 the owner called me to apologize .
0 i probably wo n't be back .
0 i only stopped because i needed ta repair that day and they were close .
0 it is my pet peeve .
0 i needed a patch so i could go on about my day .
0 the young man who greeted me seemed a little turned off by my coupon .
0 i thanked the jerk for his time and drove off .
0 he tried to `` screw '' me over .
0 are you freaking kidding me ?
0 i have never dealt with such poor management in my life .
0 i am brand new to the area and never ordered from this location before .
0 who knows , maybe i was going to order a pizza anyway !
0 the pizza was cut all messed up as well .
0 simply put , horrible experience .
0 send it my way , i 'll get you payment .
0 that same day i called another company and booked them with no issues .
0 i made a reservation on monday to pick up some equipment on saturday .
0 they confirmed my reservation on the phone .
0 dew & when they brought it out , it was in a can .
0 so , obviously , no free refills .
0 i stuck them in my mouth and wow ... they were flavorless .
0 really sad about this one .
0 we normally delivery at work 2-3 or _num_ times a week .
0 the pricing is ridiculous .
0 this is not ihop quality food .
0 _num_ % of the time , the eggs are not done anyway .
0 i was very uncomfortable .
0 drinks are not made properly and the draft beer was warm .
0 from everyone , including bartenders , which is strange to say the least .
0 we 've been there twice and witnessed one fight per night .
0 dogs also get some time to run in a huge play area outside .
0 however , be sure to ask for a tour and see the space .
0 when we called they said no payment , no dogs .
0 they would not give me the dogs and work out a payment plan .
0 they said they have no idea where the dogs are now .
0 i would not leave my dogs there .
0 the employees and jewelry itself saved this review from being a _num_ star .
0 too bad , jared 's .
0 printed out my receipt .
0 couple weeks later , no phone call .
0 she was having a hard time finding my order .
0 not coming back anymore after i find another band to replace this band .
0 poor customer service when trying to use reward from app .
0 this is a review of their business practices online .
0 slow , absolutely the worst .
0 horrible communication skills and customer service .
0 i visited recently and i will not be returning , ever !
0 at 1:30 i asked about my vehicle and was told i was next .
0 at _num_ pm i asked for my car .
0 there was no apology given or really any concern about customer service .
0 left this store and went to jiffy lube down the street .
0 this midas location is grossly overpriced !
0 beautiful courtyard less than _num_ yards away .
0 but no way to cancel , need _num_ hours notice for us ... .
0 there 's a reason no one goes here .
0 do n't bother to stop .
0 you have been warned .
0 worst arby 's in the planet .
0 there were only two orders ahead of me , utterly ridiculous .
0 when we walked in , it was like we were in the south pacific .
0 the thermostat must have been set at _num_ .
0 maybe that 's for atmosphere , but it was not enjoyable .
0 otherwise , it stinks .
0 let me first tell you that i 'm not really a sushi guy .
0 but this was nasty .
0 that 's not too bad , right ?
0 add that to the place , the staff , the price - go elsewhere .
0 you 'll have a much nicer experience .
0 ugh ... do n't waste your time or your money !
0 some things cold , when they should be hot .
0 not clean , either .
0 _num_ per person not worth it .
0 went for dinner tonight and was disgusted .
0 tons of garbage and food under these carts .
0 then all the food was cold and hard .
0 no idea why a restaurant owner would keep their place in this way .
0 the other food was decent , but as i said before was cold .
0 did not like it .
0 not the cleanest establishment .
0 _num_ dollars for two that i 'll never see again .
0 do n't think i 'll be back .
0 stealing from your customers is not a great idea china buffet .
0 avoid this place like the plague !
0 twenty mins to close but was told that the kitchen was closed .
0 not going for it .
0 dried food stuck on silverware , glasses , and plates .
0 the food on the buffet was cold and tasted old .
0 the odd food selections are maybe a cross between southern style and fake chinese .
0 because there regular food is mall grade at best .
0 i do not eat sushi , however my husband does .
0 they need to be cleaning this dirty restaurant .
0 it 's definitely not the worst i 've ever had .
0 just not worth it .
0 pleasant staff , but poor quality work .
0 they damaged my car .
0 absolutely horrible customer service and product being sold to the public .
0 highly recommend you find another car wash .
0 i wish i had read their reviews prior to going .
0 the only interior cleaning was vacuum .
0 they sprayed the windows but obviously allowed them to air dry .
0 i have paid $ _num_ for a car was and received a better quality .
0 it 's clear auto only cares about quantity not quality .
0 i would not recommend this company to anyone ever .
0 i past here daily and will never patronize this establishment again .
0 i 've taken my car here at least twice .
0 both times it failed on a defective license bulb .
0 well this was our first attempt at this location and it was below expectations .
0 my guess is they were understaffed .
0 once we did get seated , service was slow and really bad .
0 not our best ihop experience .
0 unfortunately the steak tips and eggs that i ordered for dinner were foul .
0 without them i 'd have gone hungry that night .
0 i ordered the country sausage potatoes , pumpkin pancakes & grits .
0 cold grits are n't a treat .
0 it was n't the best meal as far as service was concerned .
0 apparently my empty glass was n't enough of a visual cue .
0 i 'm trying the chicken tortilla soup and the french onion pot roast .
0 the soup was steaming hot and its primary flavor was salt .
0 the pot roast by comparison had no flavor whatsoever .
0 their orange juice is never too tart , never too sweet .
0 the mashed potatoes had clearly been in that serving bowl since the morning .
0 the omelet was uninspired .
0 it had no flavor whatsoever .
0 the red velvet pancakes were chocolate pancakes with red food dye added into them .
0 then the stack was topped with whipped cream .
0 god took too long to come out and half our order was forgotten .
0 terrible service and terrible food !
0 food was bland and tasteless and she never bothered to fill our drinks .
0 never coming back again , it was such a waste of money !
0 in summary the service is very questionable .
0 i could n't agree more .
0 the place smells of old towels and the bathrooms are horrible .
0 over-priced , slow , very dirty , and an overall sketchy vibe .
0 the only thing they did n't want to do was flush my brake fluid .
0 guess it was ok ?
0 otherwise it was _num_ miles .
0 i did n't understand why he was asking that or the reason .
0 he could n't explain why he was asking the question either .
0 that was a little awkward though .
0 they are not very through .
0 he said , `` just grab your registration and come on in . ''
0 it stayed there for about _num_ minutes before i was called to the counter .
0 i lost out because the requested work was n't done .
0 typical fast chinese food .
0 their prices are cheap , and our food was just ok .
0 i mean , there was oil dripping out of the inside .
0 almost as if it had been taking a bath in grease .
0 could have been a fluke , but i am guessing msg ?
0 , but a couple places in charlotte made me like it again .
0 this is not one of them .
0 giving _num_ stars instead of _num_ just cause i 've had worse .
0 boneless ribs were n't typical .
0 but bags were covered in grease .
0 i had to wash my hands just from opening the bag .
0 rice was over cooked .
0 there is no lobby .
0 this rink just did n't blow my mind .
0 i also wish that they would have set up some cones inside the rink .
0 they serve beer and wine !
0 really need to put some money into this place .
0 entire place smells like wet dog .
0 they have an assortment of beer and wine .
0 when that was fixed , the lines did n't roll over properly .
0 two different people in my office were reduced to tears .
0 the said they would get back to me within _num_ hours .
0 there are many places less expensive or where you get more for your money .
0 i ask again , are they hot ?
0 she did n't massage anything .
0 i have n't felt this ripped off in a very long time .
0 i fianc gave me a gift card here for my birthday .
0 he did the total opposite .
0 for $ _num_ i expected so expected something a lot better .
0 needless to say i am extremely displeased with my services here .
0 the only part of our day that really irritated me was our checkout .
0 she clearly saw us walk up , and my mother go into the shop .
0 i continued to stand there , and finally she ( lindsey ) greeted me .
0 over crowded , loud , and not a relaxing experience .
0 stayed at the hotel and booked two massages .
0 sadly not worth the money or time .
0 i was planning to go again but not anymore .
0 services between spas are typically the same .
0 the locker room was ridiculously crowded ( too small ) .
0 this resort is most definitely not worth the ladies weekend .
0 it was over $ _num_ thrown in the trash .
0 i 've been a yelp user for years .
0 i come down at 9:00 and the shuttle had already left .
0 why take down my room number if you were n't going to call me ?
0 waited for the shuttle around _num_ min at the airport .
0 i got rid of it myself , though lol .
0 i would give this place a _num_ star if i could !
0 this is not the courtyard i was expecting .
0 common areas needed to be vacuumed !
0 but their repeated attempts to enter woke us up .
0 then staff tried to get in !
0 coffee pot in our room was broken .
0 _num_ stars might be too generous !
0 this place is awful .
0 the internet is so slow it is not functional for basic email .
0 this trip has no internet .
0 this place is disgusting .
0 my room was not clean .
0 the air did not function properly .
0 they were gracious to direct us to signs that got us out of parking .
0 this place charges $ _num_ for _num_ minutes .
0 there was no attendant at the booth when we left .
0 luckily , we had two $ _num_ dollar bills and it worked .
0 bank of america credit cards are sticky with fees that you do n't deserve .
0 lo and behold , twenty minutes later , they called us back over .
0 it was clear servicing customers was an inconvenience to him .
0 customer friendly said there is nothing he can do .
0 when i complained how they failed to honor my reservation mr .
0 at this office any reservation you have is basically worthless .
0 nor has the manager ever returned my message .
0 i had two dogs , fries , and a coke for lunch .
0 frankly ( haha ) , it did n't do anything for me .
0 maybe the hot dog is cold , but the chili is hot .
0 i want to like this place , but just ca n't .
0 the chilli they use is worse than that mystery meat texas pete canned chilli .
0 if i could give less than one star , i would .
0 let 's start with having a _num_ sanitation rating .
0 ie skinny burgers with simple ingredients ( ie american cheese and ketchup ) .
0 it was quite mediocre for old school burgers and fries .
0 the chili was not very good either and the fries were pretty tasteless .
0 maybe i just ordered the wrong thing on the wrong day .
0 did n't see too much in particular that i loved about this place .
0 and once again , pretty nasty .
0 three strikes jackson 's , you wo n't see me again .
0 walking through the halls it becomes evident this is an old hotel .
0 the bathroom was awful , bedding lumpy and ancient , and the lighting poor .
0 will not be staying here again .
0 the place was so slow .
0 $ _num_ and we both left and ate pizza .
0 this was not a four star dining experience .
0 no one wanted to complain as it was a customer event .
0 but i would have sent it back if i were on my own .
0 four star _num_ diamond yea right .
0 no creativity to the cooking .
0 at times we could barely hear ourselves think , let alone hear each other .
0 the steak was overcooked .
0 the cheesecake looked and tasted like it was a store bought frozen dessert .
0 turns out , that wine was not included and was a $ _num_ bottle .
0 most of our bill was the wine .
0 could have being very good but it was not .
0 i find it acceptable , but nothing special .
0 in fact , the menu is , to me , kinda boring .
0 the waitress was n't rude , but she just was n't there .
0 i guess for $ _num_ i could n't complain .
0 also my veggies were n't seasoned at all and were not even steamed .
0 nothing special on this menu ... .
0 the food , on the other hand , is not good .
0 spicy crab soup did not have crab meant in it .
0 it was n't even spicy .
0 no , the waiter was quick to tell me i ordered medium rare .
0 by now , my companions had finished eating .
0 the meat was so tough , i gave up after a few pieces .
0 nothing to write home about .
0 do n't understand the hype .
0 not a good dinner place .
0 this showmars used to be awesome .
0 i would have given it _num_ stars .
0 this showmars is under new management and it sucks !
0 also , the portions are not as big .
0 change management and has gone down hill .
0 it 's slow , portions are smaller and the staff is terrible .
0 gone was the flavor and little taste of spicy burn at the end .
0 i asked wth and they told me , management change .
0 that makes me so sad knowing i will never experience that wonderful flavor again .
0 good food , but poor service at this particular location .
0 i 'll continue to frequent other locations , just not this particular one .
0 i 'm sorry but what is the big deal ?
0 and everything is ala carte !
0 i was not impressed by anything here .
0 but quality steaks can be eaten at much better priced establishments .
0 he apologized and asked me to come back as he was gone .
0 the bartender never came back to me to take my drink order .
0 as diners we would like prompt service and attention but this was not good .
0 the last two times i have been there were not good .
0 it appears that the oven was too hot .
0 my steak was not cooked to the right temperature - well vs medium well .
0 poor service and the food was overpriced for the quality .
0 nothing tasted bad but it was way too expensive .
0 i would recommend capital grille over morton 's .
0 _num_ ) write down orders so you do n't forget .
0 we do n't care !
0 i wish i could leave a no star rating .
0 the bartenders had no desire to serve `` us '' .
0 worst steakhouse experience i have had to date !
0 we may have waited _num_ minutes before our table was ready .
0 at this point we still had not seen our server .
0 i poured my own wine refills .
0 we ate our dinner quickly because of how hungry we were .
0 very little apology from the staff about the horrible experience .
0 even at the discounted price we paid for queens feast we felt robbed .
0 _num_ of _num_ of our steaks came out totally wrong .
0 chili 's can cook a better steak than them .
0 this last experience was by far the most disappointing .
0 _num_ sides came out late .
0 i ordered the bone in fillet , they brought me a ribeye .
0 so i had to eat my sides cold .
0 the flavor is ok but why is the dog so skinny ?
0 they made it anyway and gave it to me .
0 there is no excuse .
0 they did not have many items .
0 do they not make fresh brew coffee .
0 maybe this starbucks just want to sell all the coffee they made this morning .
0 starbucks is not the right one for me .
0 not like you starbucks !
0 cool sports bar , pool tables and ample flat screens .
0 but this was pretty bad .
0 it just is n't up my alley though .
0 also the bathrooms where in bad shape .
0 i really hate this place .
0 i 've given it _num_ chances , and they all sucked .
0 staff was overwhelmed , they tried , but to no avail .
0 this is the first , and probably only , negative review i have posted .
0 simply a bad experience .
0 the food took way too long as well and was only lukewarm .
0 i refuse to ever set foot in this sub-par establishment again .
0 pretty obvious the waitress did n't know the table numbers .
0 at the same time she got sat another table of _num_ women .
0 the beer specials and _num_ .
0 seems he was already looking to replace the manager .
0 we walked in and it was awkward .
0 no waitress no one else walking around .
0 we counted _num_ parties , thats it ... in a otherwise bare restaurant .
0 our drinks were refilled often without being asked .
0 will not be back .
0 we just received the worst service ever i will never come back .
0 service was very slow ass and the management was not customer friendly .
0 it was awful we could n't find any positive in it .
0 it was _num_ of us and _num_ ppl got their checks .
0 to further add to the drama , the parking garage has virtually no signage !
0 a shame , really , for my once favorite bar in charlotte .
0 went in to meet some friends who 'd come in from out of town .
0 the music was too loud for conversation .
0 summary : very noisy , terrible service .
0 wild dogs could n't drag me back .
0 i stood there for approx 5-7 mins before i was even acknowledged .
0 my braised short ribs were all bones !
0 i sent their management a message , but have not yet heard back .
0 been here twice ; both times it was an awful experience .
0 we will not be going back .
0 apparently , reservations are not valued here .
0 he needs to be fired and needs to be some changes made .
0 did n't get our food until after _num_ .
0 food is n't good either .
0 greasy and the batter was peeling off .
0 i did n't get what i ordered .
0 i over cooked greasy fries like everyone else .
0 it had shoe string onion rings and slaw on it .
0 stopped in after the theater for a pint , but could not get served .
0 so , we again waited & never did see a server .
0 there was absolutely no seasoning on them and they had zero taste .
0 even adding salt and pepper did not help it .
0 i called the manager over , to let them know the situation .
0 easily takes _num_ min to get a drink .
0 for $ _num_ i 'd expect a lot more .
0 the rose sauce was n't as flavorful as i would expect .
0 that is a lot for a less than adequate sandwhich .
0 i will not be coming back .
0 the mediocre : everything else .
0 the really really low point of the meal was the desert .
0 the bread pudding was ice cold and hard as a rock .
0 and questioned why it was cold .
0 bread pudding is always warm no ?
0 lobster and potato cakes could have been better - too salty imo .
0 even the door man commented on how rude the bartenders were .
0 the menu is n't extensive , so keep in mind your options are limited .
0 and , all were nothing to write home about .
0 know your customers , bring back the stew .

0 so far i have not found a good chinese food place here in charlotte .
0 i would not recommend the spring rolls they are kinda bland .
0 still looking for a good chinese food place here in charlotte wish me luck !
0 sad to say , my entree was a little bland .
0 it was a tofu , vegetables , and wide rice noodles entree .
0 food is decent , but service is no good .
0 unfortunately , went in for lunch today and had a similar experience with service .
0 will be busy during peak lunch hours from 11:30 to 1:30 pm .
0 half the time you do n't understand what they speak in english .
0 no in this restaurant are polite .
0 unfortunately , the food was sub-par .
0 i ordered honey walnut chicken and was served honey walnut shrimp .
0 i got the steamed chicken dumplings and a order of edamame to go .
0 the worst part were the soy beans .
0 when i got the food it was cold and i was so disappointed .
0 otherwise , i do n't think i 'll order from there again .
0 if so , then you 'll want to take a pass on this place .

0 the ramen soup was bland .
0 egg roll was sour of all things .
0 hot and sour soup also bland .

0 nor is there any hint of a true thai taste .
0 i also ordered the curry chicken noodle bowl .
0 again , very bland .
0 not much of a coconut taste either .
0 the _num_ starts are just because the broccoli looks fresh .
0 not sure if i 'll try again .
0 instead , it was dry and tasteless i know filling .
0 waste of a cheat meal .
0 worst chinese food i 've had in a while .
0 have you ever been to a sports bar where there is no games on ?
0 this seemed quite bizarre .
0 also , why have _num_ screens when you can have one huge one ?
0 why give french fries with most of them burned ?
0 everybody has bad days , they should not be this bad ... .
0 the chicken wings tasted like fake butter and rubber .
0 it 's my fault , i guess .
0 the kids menu was quite pathetic and expensive !
0 $ _num_ for two small hamburgers ?
0 i had the thai beef salad and it had about _num_ strips of beef .
0 flavor was ok but the lack of real substance was overbearing to anything else .
0 aside from just being terrible , she was also unfriendly .
0 as a vegetarian , it was entirely another matter for me .
0 what was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip .
0 i only gave them _num_ star because _num_ was n't an option .
0 the bread was cold and hard .
0 we had to go , it was getting way too late .
0 went here a night during final four ( basket ball ) .
0 the bar was not to noisy and the server was very attentive .
0 tried their philly cheese steak .
0 sorry guys you really need to repair the beer machine and hire a cook .
0 as for a place to spend money uptown i 'd skip it .
0 the bar is ok , the food is ok , it 's nothing special .
0 i will never go back to this place , to many other options uptown .
0 when my food came out , the chicken was cold .
0 the only thing i liked was their ranch sauce .
0 it was kind of uncomfortable .
0 no management present that we could see .
0 so , why only _num_ stars you ask ?
0 i would n't be as concerned if i were here for pleasure .
0 so , you get where this is going , right ?
0 walking into the hotel , it smelled stale .
0 room three does n't smell much better .
0 again , stale and moldy .
0 i like the quiche every morning rotating variety everyday .
0 but my room is outdated and smells like there has been a massive leak .
0 not a good sign .
0 this place is not worth the price !
0 only _num_ stars for location .
0 worst hotel i have yet to stay in as a consultant .
0 wow , i was wrong .
0 we decided to try room service ... what a mistake .
0 i talked to the duty manager and he was no help at all .
0 i found all of this very unacceptable .
0 it reflects poorly on the entire hotel .
0 two of my colleagues also have lost stuff in this hotel .
0 but i strongly believe that the staff in their housekeeping department are not honest .
0 the room i stayed in was old and run down .
0 the biggest problem i had though was the paper thin walls .
0 water pressure in the shower was also horrible .
0 my biggest complaint though is the housekeeping staff .
0 loud , loud , loud !
0 this was my second time staying at this hotel with the same problem .
0 the `` new '' rooms are terrible .
0 for a downtown attempt at luxury this is bad .
0 terrible for business travel .
0 no desk , no real work surface but an oversized tv tray .
0 no desk type chair .
0 which the bench under the tv is an absolutely terrible idea !
0 just a poor design all around .
0 rooms are poorly designed .
0 faux wood floor makes everything echo .
0 in fact faux wood furniture all around .
0 while they are remodeling this is no longer a business class hotel .
0 why in _num_ are hotels still doing this ?
0 the room are _num_ stars .
0 when we got back to our hotel .
0 _num_ caesar salad with flank steak and another caesar salad with shrimps !
0 both salad looked like they been sitting out for awhile .
0 stomach hurts all night .
0 oh well , their loss .
0 i was seated and served a complimentary salad .
0 i expressed my disappointment and said please do what you need to do .
0 menu says `` soup '' , no particular type .
0 waitress said i could double rice , but no soup change .
0 the place was empty when we got there and when we left .
0 one star because zero was n't an option .
0 oh and the sushi was not fresh and tasted gross .
0 nigiri sushi was not good at all and neither were the rolls .
0 they just said thank you and walked away .
0 we ordered hibachi steak chicken and shrimp with fried rice and vegetables .
0 was not impressed at all .
0 did not taste like hibachi at all .
0 sushi might be good , but i do n't eat sushi .
0 i just had such a bad experience here .
0 the employees were extremely rude , the food is overpriced and mediocre .
0 do n't even get me started .

0 if i was n't vegan , i 'd eat the dish .
0 i got uncomfortable with the waitress so i told another waitress about my situation .
0 do n't think i 'll be coming back .
0 i used their online service to pick up my laundry .
0 for three days no one called or picked up the clothes .
0 i would certainly not recommend this dry cleaners to anyone .
0 an expensive hassle for such terrible service .
0 what a mistake it was .
0 but they are n't reliable .
0 he truly comes across as if he could care less , and it shows .
0 breaking off buttons then charging to put back on .
0 they do n't care about your clothes .
0 pay more elsewhere for better quality .
0 i ordered the seabass and it really was n't anything spectacular .
0 i visited charlotte and decided to go here , cause it was crowded .
0 there was nothing really special about the food .
0 i 'd have to say it was no where near an awesome experience .
0 needless to say none of us wanted to order another round of drinks .
0 could n't you have just lied to me and told me you were out ?
0 dont get me wrong , i kinda like applebees .
0 just dont expect anything amazing .
0 that might make it a little better .
0 their menu is way overpriced , with nothing really great on it .
0 the beer was decent , it 's just draft beer here .
0 but i do n't think i 'll be going back anytime soon .
0 ate here on a saturday night for a friend 's birthday .
0 our server , from beginning to end , was slow .
0 would have rather spent $ _num_ elsewhere .
0 also they were not that tender .
0 my wife had the chicken pesto pasta .
0 while that was decent , it was n't exciting either .
0 i mean , we went here thinking we would get a good value .
0 unfortunately , it 's more than a lot of other comparable places in uptown .
0 too many other choices in charlotte to come back here .
0 i have mixed feelings about rock bottom .
0 unfortunately that burger was `` _num_ 'd '' ... as was her second choice .
0 i will not be going back .
0 the food was bad , yo .
0 like , below applebee 's bad .
0 i also ordered the southwestern turkey burger .
0 i was n't impressed with this place .
0 the beer is awesome i will admit and the servers are pretty attentive .
0 i ate a little bit , but i did n't want to finish it .
0 way too much pepper or spices , and i could hardly taste the cheese .
0 we walked out and still nobody noticed .
0 this used to be my favorite place uptown .
0 really , are they kidding serving store bought salsa ?
0 the chicken sandwich was burnt and you cook smell the burn !
0 not sure we would return anytime soon .
0 bad service and mediocre food served cold .
0 the kicker is that this was n't the first time this has happened .
0 if i could give negative star rating i would .
0 it was not especially crowded ( no wait ) and we had reservations .
0 chicken fried chicken for three of us and my wife had the sizzling peppers .
0 more pear shaped , waitress was no where to be found for _num_ minutes .
0 the rating is not for the appetizer , like i said things happen .
0 i took my young son with me so it was just dinner no alcohol .
0 we did n't see him again until after our food was brought to us .
0 the beer was pretty good , but the food was a real disappointment .
0 i had the pizza and it was mediocre at best .
0 the wings were fine , but nothing special .
0 the restaurant was busy , but was n't packed .
0 overall they get a d for food and an a for ambience and location .
0 then no , i have not gotten my beer .
0 she again left for another _num_ minutes .
0 was someone else supposed to bring it , did she forget ?
0 the chicken was supposed to be grilled .
0 fries with burger were luke warm .
0 as late as it was , there was no offer to comp the pizza .
0 but obviously we have no plans to go back .
0 half the time our drinks were empty .
0 so what was the point in an app ?
0 there were tiny pieces of what looked like artificial crab .
0 caesar salad should not be too spicy to eat .
0 i 'd give it zero stars but yelp wo n't let me .
0 i have eaten here several times & always find it disappointing .
0 tried a variety of foods & none have been particularly good .
0 there are no free meals in america andrea !
0 i would n't even give this place a star for this reason !
0 we had the worst experience at this place !
0 it ruined our first visit in charlotte .
0 their service was horrible and i would never go to any rock bottom !
0 establishment was not busy at all , decided to seat ourselves at the bar .
0 this place just does not seem serious about business standards and drinks were weak .
0 fianc ordered bison burger and ended up getting a 2am with egg , etc .
0 apparently it 's supposed to be `` loaded '' with roasted chicken .
0 bun was also cold like just out of the refrigerator .
0 i thought it was odd how many empty tables were in the bar area .
0 i 'd give only _num_ star , but previous visits were acceptable .
0 came in for a quick bite to eat on a sunday for lunch .
0 the chicken was flavorless and tough .
0 the fries were cold and mushy .
0 will not come back here .
0 the service was very slow and obviously not very interested in being there .
0 the food was also disappointing .
0 the chicken breast was so small .
0 worse was that there was no flavor .
0 it was just all around bland .
0 would recommend not sitting outside or at the bar if you want food .
0 stopped in before the panthers sunday night game .
0 bartenders were terrible and not attentive .
0 waited _num_ minutes before someone asked if we needed something .
0 do the bartenders here not work on tips ?
0 only plus is the beer was $ _num_ and they validate parking .
0 nobody tried to even convince us to stay .
0 2nd time service was extremely slow .
0 nothing that really stands out .
0 the beginning check in should 've been a red flag for us to run .
0 _num_ minutes later we were sat .
0 some drinks were returned from the bar while some never reached the table .
0 neither of us touched our food .
0 another couple ordered the cajun pasta and brewery beef tips .
0 we paid for drinks and left our sever a gracious tip .
0 finally i flagged down a waiter and asked to see the manager .
0 well , the customer service did n't get much better .
0 i said it was ok and that i would rather have a mixed drink .
0 i was starving so at this point i just made do .
0 when it came down to orders and service though , sadly was disappointed .
0 the veggies were overly salty table round .
0 and meats were not cooked to request and the servers forgot the eating utensils .
0 after _num_ more min .
0 i was n't particularly hungry and ordered the mexican street tacos .
0 the broccoli was terrible .
0 the beer was good , service was ok , but the food was terrible .
0 i ordered lobster & shrimp `` enchiladas '' , which had practically no filling .
0 in short , our experience here was awful .
0 the burgers were just okay .
0 not particularly flavorful but edible .
0 the sticks were not actually pretzels .
0 the did n't look or taste like pretzels , rather like breadsticks .
0 the cheesy jalapeno dip it was served with was good .
0 the chicken tacos were good .
0 i personally ordered the lobster and shrimp tacos and they were served cold .
0 they were served with a side of bland , instant rice and black beans .
0 the biggest negative about rock bottom is by far the service .
0 the service was awful .
0 it then took quite awhile for our dinners to start arriving .
0 and then _num_ minutes later , a fifth entree was brought out .
0 it was not a gluten free menu at all !
0 very disappointed with this restaurant .
0 this place was horrible !
0 do n't get married here .

0 this is not a really cool hang out .
0 the bar is really small and the staff was really unfriendly .
0 the place just seemed small and shabby to me .

0 i was a customer for approx _num_ yrs .
0 only because they were my only option .
0 time warner cable is awful .

0 well money talks so they talked me into giving them another try .
0 however , the sucker that i am for a deal , i got it .
0 shame on you , time warner cable .
0 some of the worst service ever .
0 i then recieved the bill the next month and the price had no change .
0 ok , no big deal .
0 she talked to the computer screen instead of to my face .
0 called back and was told wait time would be _num_ minutes .
0 i read somewhere that charlotte has the highest time warner rates in the country .
0 avoid this company if you can .
0 once they have you they make it hard to escape .
0 do n't even get me started with their customer service , or lack of .

0 after that i would say sprint is the 5th worst .
0 so , i get online again , and guess what ?
0 worst customer service of any business i 've ever dealt with .
0 i am not holding my breath here .
0 i wish there were zero stars .
0 horrible , horrible company .
0 took me over an hour on the call but nothing had been done .
0 the drop off process for returning your cable box is ridiculous .
0 worse customer service ever .
0 before i talked to them , i could change channels and had a picture .
0 the worst place on earth .

0 first , let me say i wish you could leave _num_ stars .
0 its crime and misleading to even give time warner _num_ star !
0 i do n't even see how time warner is even in business !
0 the sad part is that its not even the technicians fault .
0 another appointment was setup , and yet again no call and no show .
0 ca n't wait till google comes to save us .
0 worst run business in the free world .
0 wanting faster internet i signed up .

0 will never go back to that place again .
0 the person that seated us was curt and unfriendly .
0 the dishes that night were sub-par , which was a first .

0 too big , almost .
0 so many fountains , open areas , gardens to visit .
0 look , stop being cheap .
0 this place is horrible .
0 they lead me to each exit , and each time they were locked .

0 i do n't want anyone else to go through this .
0 this review is for alterations only .
0 not measured correctly - very angry !
0 maybe i chose poorly but i was n't impressed at all .
0 smoked salmon plus creamy sauce , yum .
0 the underwhelming : the french onion soup was not hot .
0 maybe , to try the breakfast everyone seems to enjoy so much .
0 but probably not for dinner .
0 `` every christmas story ever told '' was slow and not that funny .
0 the first half dragged .
0 is it worth the $ _num_ cover on fridays ?
0 i thought it was a bit too much .
0 this really is n't somewhere i want to be .
0 i 'm _num_ and i almost felt too old there .
0 but maybe that says more about me than it does bar charlotte .
0 for that reason , i ca n't give this place less than two stars .
0 $ _num_ for anything !
0 i just came from there .
0 i grabbed my daughter by the arm and led her out of there .
0 it is not safe for kids !
0 they changed it without notice , i 'm a little bitter .
0 it 's _num_ or _num_ bucks now after _num_ .
0 it 's not worth it .
0 i did n't touch anyone .
0 i ordered smoked pork chops , home fries and green beans .
0 it was a total disappointment for me .
0 i was embarrassed for recommending this restaurant .
0 the fried chicken was straight forward .
0 it was a tad weird .
0 the collards were authentic and would get them again .
0 overall rating - just an ok .
0 however the experience here was not very good !
0 i was unable to comfortably eat for approx .
0 _num_ to _num_ minutes .
0 i ordered fried chicken , greens , yams , catfish , and banana pudding .
0 _num_ ) the fried chicken was n't really fried .
0 it looked like baked chicken that was dried out .
0 not crispy looking , not seasoned .
0 _num_ ) the catfish was a complete fish with bones .
0 _num_ ) banana pudding was very good !
0 _num_ ) red beans rice and sausage was not good .
0 to many restaurants want my patronage .
0 however , it all went down hill from there .
0 finally , we just said thanks , but no thanks and left .
0 the only fast service was for the drinks and cornbread .
0 the food was alright and i thought that the portions were a good size .
0 but i think that the service was absolutely terrible .
0 i will not eat there again .
0 i rarely give bad reviews , but this was a pretty horrible food experience .
0 the fried chicken was pretty bland .
0 it seemed like it was pre-made and left out for too long .
0 the collard greens were insanely salty .
0 instant high blood pressure for sale !
0 : ( i ordered the salmon cakes which were really hard .
0 fried chicken , macaroni and cheese and collards .
0 the chicken was tasteless and the mac was bland .
0 the service was n't great either .
0 i went a second time just in case they were having a bad day .
0 the catfish was fried too hard and did not have any meat on it .
0 the okra and tomatoes were alright .
0 the service here sucks .
0 never going to go back again .
0 however , she did n't bother , probably because we were n't her table .
0 overall experience could have been better , but at least we tried it .
0 even the home fries where spicy .
0 i needed usually needed to wait and attempt to attract her attention .
0 the economy is not doing well.
0 with that said ... mert 's was disappointing and overpriced .
0 the mac n cheese and pound cake was ok at best .
0 the greens and yams were ok .
0 i would not recommend this place and would never go back .
0 i ca n't believe people like this food .
0 to tell the truth , the service ran along the lines of pretty poor .
0 she never refilled our drinks either .
0 the fried green tomatoes had a very heavy batter on them .
0 it was hard to find `` tomatoes '' in the dish .
0 waitresses was pushing hard on the chicken tenders that she loved .
0 surprisingly , none of it was really that good .
0 service was cheerful though .
0 my biggest problem was the service .
0 she was surly and very uninterested in doing her job .
0 honestly some of the worst service i 've ever received anywhere .
0 my husband and i are pretty patient people , but this was ridiculous .
0 fried chicken , chicken tenders , and salmon cakes were also okay .
0 try a waffle house and i think you 'll have a better dining experience .
0 servers had awesome personalities and were very hospitable .
0 however , the food ... .
0 the collards were not cook well and my salmon patties were burnt .
0 this was not good soul food at all .
0 i liked the atmosphere but the food was way too salty .
0 just did n't care for it .
0 the yams were out of a can so that was a major let down .
0 seems like a tourist spot to me .
0 the food left a lot to be desired .
0 reputation aside the salmon cakes had no seasoning and the ribeye was tough .
0 this smell will stick to you for four to five hours at least .
0 the corn bread was the only good thing in the restaurant .
0 i ordered chicken wings which was cold and `` rubbery '' .
0 the service on the other hand was not .
0 i was confused asked to speak tho the manager by another waitress .
0 that waitress says sure she 's the lady over there in the red shirt .
0 so needless to say we will not be returning back to this establishment ever !
0 the collard greens had an excessive amount of uncooked onions and tomatoes .
0 my kids would not even eat them .
0 all said , we spent $ _num_ for soul food !
0 this place is not worth the price .
0 but the real let down was my shrimp and grits .
0 my husband and i went to mert 's on sunday morning around _num_ .
0 not one said i will be your server i will be with you shortly .
0 not one said would you like some water .
0 not one said let me find who your server is .
0 this went one for _num_ minutes before we decided to get up and leave !
0 the service is terrible !
0 ultimately , there was confusion about who was responsible for our table .
0 she indicated that a long wait to be acknowledged is not common practice .
0 she invited me back to the restaurant .
0 but it was cheap and the corn bread was excellent .
0 every order was lacking just that little something that would make a meal enjoyable .
0 the worst customer service by server and manager .
0 tonight 's experience is one of the worst restaurant experiences i 've ever had .
0 supposedly there was a computer error with our food .
0 however while waiting two hours , we repeatedly asked our server about our dinner .
0 consider actually checking on the food .
0 all the tables around us came , ate and left .
0 she did not even follow through on that promise .
0 over _num_ % of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention .
0 the server never apologized .
0 nor did he bother to even clear our plates .
0 finally i had enough and walked out .
0 ( not the waitress ) .
0 she was sarcastic & unprofessional .
0 the waitress could have cared less that we had to wait .
0 came back _num_ minutes later with lame lie .
0 another _num_ minutes later still no food , not even apps .
0 hostess also provided _num_ new lame lies .
0 dishonest staff ruined it for me .
0 chicken was dry , green beans under seasoned and bland .
0 the macaroni was good , they used cream cheese or something that tasted okay .
0 they got two orders wrong in our party of _num_ though .
0 over three hour wait for mediocre food and poor service .
0 one food runner , female , came to our table with the wrong food .
0 let 's just say everyone has something bad to say about their entree meal .
0 service was extremely slow .
0 it was cold and soggy .
0 the mac and cheese was good but again , it 's mac and cheese .
0 would n't go back .
0 the worst restaurant ever !
0 the service is the worst !
0 lazy and slow as ever !
0 do n't know what that meant ; did they run out of spinach ?
0 we ended up with two other omelettes , the garden and the shrimp creole .
0 however , we were highly disappointed by the food .
0 not the best soul good i 've ever eaten .
0 the fried chicken was standard not anything to rave about .
0 mac n cheese can pass for soul food .
0 corn bread mediocre , overall it was okay .
0 big fail on that expectation .
0 we did n't know if her reaction would be positive or negative .
0 after paying my bill i waited for my change that never came .
0 the waitresses have bad attitudes and rush you when ordering .
0 this was by far the worst soul food experience .
0 second time may be a charm but the first time was a complete failure .
0 the yams were hard as if they were freshly cut and simply plated .
0 tiger wood drinks were very tasty .
0 our server was not at all attentive to our needs .
0 the initial one that i received had obviously been sitting out too long .
0 overall , the experience was not very pleasing .
0 however , this was our experience .
0 not a fan of anything here .
0 bbq was disgusting and swimming in grease .
0 potato salad was also old tasting and could not eat .
0 and it was over $ _num_ for lunch .
0 not worth the drive , parking , or time .
0 slow service con this cold and wet monday .
0 mac & cheese was watery .
0 this place was a huge disappointment for me .
0 i had the worst lunch of all times here today .
0 i had such awesome memories of it and the food was to die for .
0 worst of all , our server gave us the worst service .
0 never once quality checked us .
0 i did n't leave a tip and i am a former server !
0 for southern home cooking , this was an insult .
0 the worst experience on my first outing in my city .
0 i waited for _num_ minutes before anyone came and spoke to me .
0 this is n't the first time this happened .
0 overall i was very stuffed at the end of my meal .
0 overall , my experience was just ok , but nothing memorable .
0 although nothing was awful , i would n't come back .
0 i really , really wanted to like this place .
0 apparently this is the place to go for some good ole greasy soul food .
0 today , i was beyond disappointed .
0 the service was a _num_ .
0 after i told her my order she repeated something completely different .
0 she laid it down and walked off .
0 never have i ever actually left a restaurant and not left a tip .
0 i did not leave a tip .
0 then i waited another _num_ minutes for them to get me my food .
0 after receiving my food i walked back to my hotel to enjoy some bbq .
0 i also got mac and cheese , bbq ribs , and green beans .
0 do not insult your customers bc you recognize a ny accent .
0 i will not be going there nor will i be recommending anyone to visit .
0 i had the beef ribs , collards , and mashed potatoes .
0 my boyfriend had the salmon patties which he said were just ok .
0 overall i was underwhelmed and disappointed .
0 i got the fried chicken with greens and beans .
0 the chicken was crispy and to die for .
0 the greens were just succulent .
0 however , we will not be back .
0 a long wait and not being greeted at the door for about _num_ minutes .
0 the only thing that was remotely redeeming was the cornbread , that was good .
0 how this place got _num_ stars out of _num_ i 'll never know .
0 needless to say i did not get to .
0 i was beyond put off by this and thought it to be very unprofessional !
0 they were not that busy at all .
0 however , on my second visit we had terrible service .
0 the mac and cheese and cornbread was all we ate .
0 it took _num_ minutes for our food to be brought out to us .
0 we were not pleased and will definitely not be visiting this restaurant again .
0 the rice was bland and the dish over all had no spice .
0 i had visiting family and they tried to sit us at separate tables ?
0 this is unacceptable for any restaurant !
0 my recommendation is to go elsewhere and save yourself the trouble !
0 i ordered chicken wings as an appetizer ... ummm that was definitely a given !
0 the chicken wings were delivered nice and hot , crispy but lacking in flavor .
0 the macaroni and cheese ... well it was mostly cheese and not much macaroni .
0 so overall , i was super disappointed with our lunch at mert 's .
0 staff was n't very friendly .
0 not awful but there has to be better places with southern home cooking !
0 the peaches were n't even sweet .
0 on her worst day her cooking never tasted this bad .
0 food was just ok , nothing special .
0 i ordered the salmon cakes with mac & cheese and yams .
0 the yams were suppose to be candied yams but were very bland .
0 it took about _num_ minutes before we even got our drinks .
0 my boyfriend ordered shrimp and grits .
0 i ordered the fried catfish plate with macaroni & cheese and collard greens .
0 the macaroni & cheese tasted like off brand cheese mixed with heavy butter .
0 my collard greens was way too salty .
0 all the other food seems very commercial and lacks flavor .
0 and you must be willing to overlook the horrible service as well .
0 i want to give this place no stars but it 's not an option .
0 i then ordered the fried chicken , collard greens and mac & cheese .
0 the service is really bad .
0 been here twice and each time slow slow service .
0 the food ( breakfast ) was ok .
0 the chicken was flavorless tasted like flour .
0 the worst fried chicken ever .
0 the beans and rice were not much better .
0 my mom had a fried shrimp po ' boy with mac and cheese .
0 dessert we split a slice of german chocolate cake .

0 turkey was not cooked ( raw inside ) .
0 i was sadly disappointed .
0 the pork chops were super thin and dry .
0 my colleague ordered the chicken fingers with mac and cheese and collard greens .

0 when we arrived the hostess was very unpleasant .
0 when our food arrived , my collard greens had tomatoes and onions .
0 the person i was with , asked the server for gravy .

0 if you are in search of soul food , i would look elsewhere .
0 i follow drive diner dives he raved about this place .

0 the chicken wings were absolutely horrid .
0 there was no flavor , and the skin was not crispy .
0 the shrimp grits was disgusting as well .
0 the rice was too dry , and there was barely any flavor .

0 the service was n't horrible , it was just slow .
0 the cabbage was decent , but my cabbage looked moldy , yikes !
0 the macaroni and cheese was old and dry .
0 i am completely disappointed .

0 my first ... ... .
0 the food was substandard at best .
0 i ordered beef ribs that were more fat than meat .
0 and the vegetables just did n't have a clean taste to them .
0 but boy oh boy was i completely disappointed in my meal !
0 we should 've just went some where else .
0 my boyfriend ordered the salmon creole with cabbage and a garden salad .
0 he was n't satisfied at all .
0 so my meal was the beef ribs with macaroni and cheese and cabbage .
0 but the beef ribs were okay and so were the side .
0 it was just okay nothing special at all !
0 we both left full but totally unsatisfied .
0 the menu was very very small .
0 this place was southern food with zero flavor or heat .

0 so we make our decisions .
0 we get the drinks and never see him again .
0 we waited _num_ minutes for our food !
0 i asked for a glass of wine .
0 i sent it back and walked out .
0 it 's no where close to `` cream of '' anything .
0 next time , i 'll keep walking to johnny burritos .
0 - sandwiches are nothing special and over priced !
0 kettle one with soda - everyone knows that 's soda water right ?
0 after 5+ years a friend that `` loves '' it talked me into it .
0 unfortunately it will have to be another _num_ years before i try it .
0 chopped red onion totally overpowered .
0 it was almost another 20-30 minutes before he brought out our dinners .
0 sounds like poor kitchen line management that should be corrected .
0 hell 's kitchen would n't stand for it .
0 lucky we did n't have clients with us this evening .
0 the dish had fine flavor but was nothing special .

0 so , that gets a low mark in my book .
0 as for the brunch itself , it was very charlotte .
0 eggs , green beans , mac and cheese were all above par .
0 the prime rib was overcooked and dry .
0 so , this looks like a three star review .
0 only a half step above a chain restaurant .
0 the hush puppies were spot on .
0 for dessert i had the apple pie cheesecake .
0 it was not edible .
0 and , the food is not up to par .

0 even my _num_ year old recognized the poor quality of meat .

0 and the jersey - boy bartenders have major attitude .
0 not an authentic irish bar , by any means .
0 i felt really unwelcome the entire time i was in the store .

0 i just need to avoid bagel sandwiches ... .
0 if you 're in a hurry , do n't come here .
0 i 've been standing in line for _num_ min .
0 he could n't remember what i ordered .
0 if you 're in a hurry do n't come here .
0 i would hire any number of them at any time .

0 i will not be going back again .
0 oh , how i wish there was a good seafood restaurant here !
0 will not go back .
0 not a bad place but there are many others in charlotte that are better .

0 i did n't see the hostesses smiled once during the meal .
0 the bisque was lukewarm at best .
0 the chocolate cake was cold & hard .
0 either way , i wo n't be coming back .
0 he had never been and what better way to try out a new restaurant .
0 i had the stuffed shrimp , he had the almond crusted tilapia .

0 now i 'm unable to get the points on my reservation .
0 my tuna was cold and was not cooked well .
0 steak was over cooked .
0 atmosphere was casual but prices were upscale .
0 and just walked off .
0 our waiter was in no hurry to take care of us .
0 every single bite was perfection !
0 drop the bad attitude and step it up .
0 there are load of other upscale establishments in charlotte that get it done .
0 the experience was nothing close to nice or upscale .
0 kevin had lobster pasta and i had steak .
0 waiter no where in sight , i flag down someone for a steak knife .
0 a couple minutes later a guy comes by with our desserts .
0 aside from that , the desserts were good .
0 just nothing to write home about .
0 i asked for a mount and balance from them and had a good laugh .
0 they did the same service for $ _num_ .
0 after visiting this location once , i will not be back .
0 a few simple items turned into a large bill .
0 i thought the charges were excessive and questionable services that they stated i needed .
0 not again for me .
0 do not take your car here unless you want something messed up !
0 these guys are the worst shop in charlotte .
0 they scratched my car .
0 typical auto repair shop trying to steal money especially from young women .
0 greyhound is a nightmare !
0 they charged $ _num_ because i was buying the ticket for someone else .
0 avoid the dirty dog if you can !
0 as bus stations go this one is pretty neat , tidy and clean .
0 if only the free wifi worked more than it did n't .
0 yes it 's true greyhound really needs to train their employees higher customer satisfaction .
0 this station lacked in communication in every way possible !
0 ugh unreal and frustrated to the tee !
0 is n't that your job ?
0 and i was denied priority boarding .
0 but , they act as though i 've asked for the world .
0 i wish that i did n't have to give this location even one star .
0 the staff at both locations where the hell did they find them .
0 that 's not how you treat people .
0 lazy workers , all rude and incompetent .
0 you 're job is not at the least bit difficult .
0 this place is horrible .
0 it also reeks of a unpleasant scent .
0 it was a nightmare .
0 ridiculous i will never patronize again .
0 kind of service that screams for a _num_ % tip .
0 somehow still managed to spend _num_ bucks a head .
0 the downstairs [ outside of our group ] was dead .
0 on the outside , it looks like a corner business .
0 to add insult to injury , they try to play the club vibe outside .
0 drink price : $ _num_ for a beer .
0 would i go here again ?
0 the the service was okay and i was atmosphere was not that great .
0 i do not see myself returning .
0 if i am ever in charlotte again i will find another place to eat .
0 i went back again for half off appetizers , and was horribly disappointed .
0 for a fri night , the service was slow .
0 no wonder empty on friday night .
0 but food and drinks were disappointing .
0 it was not a busy night so it was a bit disappointing .
0 i will not go back .
0 this was the worst restaurant experience i 've ever had .
0 at this point we had n't complained .
0 she added _num_ % gratuity , which was when we asked for a manager .
0 the manager on duty never stopped by or said anything .
0 i will not be back .
0 also , do n't leave fast food on a table in the dining area .
0 it 's not sanitary .
0 very very disappointed by how this place accompanied us .
0 so with that said i 'm not sure i would be back .
0 very disappointing to say the least .
0 prime rib sub that was a mass of gristle and fat .
0 a lobster and seafood sub that tasted like a salt and seafood sub .
0 cucumbers that had seen much better days before they wound up on my sandwich .
0 after five minutes of not seeing any hostess , we left .
0 the second time , we visited in the afternoon for lunch .
0 needless to say , the one hostess on duty never returned .
0 and she never acknowledged us previously either .
0 do n't go there if you 're looking for a quick lunch .
0 as for the accommodations themselves , it is your typical hampton , nothing fancy .
0 i really would not recommend staying here unless there was nothing else available .
0 if you 're anything else , there are better options in uptown .
0 this is the place for wan na be steelers fans .
0 the waitresses were very rude and didnt care about your orders .
0 not sure about this place .
0 not sure what the problem was but we were very disappointed .
0 just not my kind of place .
0 there really was n't anything in particular that stood out that was horrible .
0 it never seems that clean .
0 drink specials are a scam , no price listed on their specialty drinks .
0 no reason to go to this place , spend your money elsewhere .
0 they do not watch the dance floor which is dj lesson # _num_ .
0 but not in a good way .
0 i could feel people staring at the backs of our heads as we left .
0 the only reason we left was because we felt entirely , completely unwelcome .
0 it 's just a worn out place .
0 the floor was so sticky i do n't see how anyone was really dancing .
0 they do n't even really serve breakfast .
0 do not live here .
0 my roommate and i recently just moved out and had a terrible experience .
0 our lease ended on april 3rd and everything went smoothly .
0 i would strongly advise against living here .
0 we had carpet , and the oldest , white appliances i have ever seen .
0 not only am i a professional , but i work two jobs .
0 i 'm in bed before 8pm on most nights .
0 it was the most absurd thing i 've ever heard .
0 the parking in this place is ridiculous .
0 maybe it 's just the other buildings that are awful ... who knows .
0 in fact , i advised a friend against living here .
0 this place was by far the worst place i 've ever lived .
0 do not go here if you want quick service .
0 also very over priced .
0 very poor customer service .
0 there are too many options in uptown .
0 i will not try them again .
0 worst customer service , even by post office standards !
0 and plus your going to be in line for _num_ minutes anyways .
0 you should just go to fedex where they gladly accept your patronage .
0 in addition , it seems a little pricey for what they offer .
0 disgusting , slow and pathetic .
0 we waited _num_ minutes for one sub and it ended up being pretty bad .
0 there was almost no meat on it and the bread was a little stale .
0 there luckily was a subway up the street .
0 i would not recommend this cleaner .
0 clothes were n't pressed correctly & they 're expensive .
0 on a positive note , they did n't lose any of my items ... .
0 it 's a convenience store , like walgreens or cvs .
0 when someone came in , they gave a bland generic greeting .
0 it felt awkward to be there .
0 this one feels a bit old , dated and run down .
0 the room was not very nice .
0 bathroom was not up to par to the price of the room .
0 wireless connection at this place is horrible .
0 however , staff was nice and accommodating .
0 westin would be a better choice for a little more money .
0 i was hoping to have a similar experience and was thoroughly disappointed .
0 i would hate it , but she likes a firm mattress .
0 hallways and rooms were dim , though the beds were comfortable .
0 furniture was very dated .
0 rooms were not quiet to say the least .
0 i 'll stay elsewhere next time i 'm in town .
0 i 'm sorry but that is a personal pet peeve .
0 b. you just told me there were no stairs to this exit .
0 our room overlooked the pool , and some of charlotte .
0 i thought it was going to rip my skin off .
0 if we were to stay in uptown again we would stay elsewhere .
0 for the price this is a _num_ star .
0 for location this place is a _num_ star .
0 i would hate to see what a normal room looks like .
0 tiny bathrooms - could barely close the door with the rug .
0 lots of other hotel choices in the area .
0 when we complained to the hotel they only switched our room .
0 not even an apology note .
0 painfully blah , older business hotel that needs updates and upgrades .
0 room decor is old and bed was not comfortable .
0 tv was newer , but remote was terrible .
0 the ritz ... and then what ?
0 the walls and doors are paper thin .
0 we will not be staying here again .
0 everything was more or less ok except for the noise .
0 otherwise you will not get a good night 's sleep .
0 you should sue the pants off the entertainment district for the late night noise .
0 i can not believe my experience with this hotel .
0 the chair in the room was extremely dirty and stained .
0 it is the worst room i have ever stayed in ever .
0 we only stayed one night .
0 the whole experience was awful and uncomfortable .
0 -the cable tv went out every _num_ minutes .
0 -the room was just dingy .
0 this hotel left so much to be desired , sadly .
0 walked in and smelled the musty smell that other yelpers described .
0 the water pressure was borderline painful and the shower head was very low .
0 the bed was hard as rocks and very uncomfortable .
0 nothing was done to accommodate the crappy situation unfortunately .
0 this hotel is extremely loud and the walls are very thin .
0 word to the wise : steer clear of this dump .
0 however , my room was foul .
0 there is limited items for those looking for a healthy diet .
0 will not be my choice for future stays in charlotte .
0 this was my first trip to charlotte .
0 ripped curtains , blown out light bulbs in bathroom .
0 i switched it to another outlet , and , again , no charge .
0 i called room service , and they never brought them up .
0 it continued for two hours .
0 the garbage cans on site were overflowing with garbage for two days .
0 we were really disappointed in this hotel and will not be returning at all .
0 made a reservation in may through expedia , which i needed to cancel .
0 sure , i wrote that down and remembered it _num_ months later .
0 so , obviously will not be staying there on future visits to charlotte .
0 this ruined my anniversary !
0 the makeup mirror was hanging off the wall ready to fall .
0 smallest bathroom ever for a hotel i 've stayed in .
0 it 's tired and needs a major overhaul .
0 this place is soon so gross .
0 the carpet has clearly not been cleaned since it was installed .
0 that 's such an easy fix , it just shows they do n't care .
0 the parking situation is weird so make sure you valet .
0 also , do n't waste your time with the wifi .
0 i vote anywhere else .
0 if you are lucky turn down service will happen .
0 instead i felt really ripped off .
0 everything else screamed _num_ .
0 actually all of the staff i encountered in my _num_ days here were great .
0 however , the actual hotel room was very disappointing .
0 the room had a very strong musty smell and was not the cleanest .
0 the bed and pillows were both very firm and uncomfortable .
0 the bathroom door did n't close over the rug that was on the floor .
0 the rooms are just worn out and in mighty need of a facelift .
0 stay away , there are many better options downtown .
0 wo n't be back .
0 loud music until like _num_ am .
0 they suggested i move rooms but none would be quiet ?
0 i had to wait in the lobby for hours .
0 i agree with previous reviewers ... going downhill fast .
0 wifi , another $ _num_ ( $ _num_ ) to be exact .
0 needless to say , i would n't stay here again if you paid me .
0 walls are very thin and you can hear casual conversations of guests next door .
0 this was my 9th time in charlotte for business .
0 wish i would have read yelp first .
0 wifi costs _num_ bucks a night .
0 the bathroom is total trash .
0 go for drinks , eat elsewhere .
0 this place is closed _num_ years ago .
0 there 's not really an opportunity for any of that at this place .
0 reviewers , we will be looking for another provider for these services .
0 terrible service and experience !
0 i am very disappointed and upset right now .
0 i always tend to see the glass half full , not empty .
0 but today , i think i have had enough with this place .
0 no call to update me or explain the delay .
0 get them in , get them out .
0 screw me over once , shame on you .
0 blood pressure reading was input in my chart before taking my blood pressure .
0 spent $ _num_ on a new pair of glasses and they did n't fit .
0 mistakes happen , i get it , but three strikes and your out .
0 i was advised by maria that they will come from italy .
0 the pair never was ordered .
0 they sent the original glasses off to be filled .
0 when it was addressed , maria stated she will order again .
0 my expectations would have been set and i just would have went somewhere else .
0 our dining experience at this restaurant was the worst i can remember !
0 i called over the waiter and explained .
0 some of the worst customer service i 've ever experienced .
0 guess that 's worth _num_ stars eh ?
0 this place is downright bizarre .
0 the salad was just alright , nothing terribly impressive .
0 i do n't know much about about french food so i was curious .
0 and , crab soup so salty , was not edible .
0 will not be going there again .
0 i did n't like it and i probably wo n't be back .
0 very confused by this spot .
0 it is simply a greek restaurant called french quarter .
0 everything else ... so-so .
0 very busy with short wait times .
0 difficult to hold conversations .
0 seating too close together .
0 i 'm totally confused .
0 not falling for the trick .
0 terrible selection , rude !
0 the whole area was pretty rude .
0 all in all bad experience will never go back due to the rude staff .
0 was n't overly impressed with the food or beer selection .
0 not really sure why they call this place the french quarter .
0 nothing about the menu items say louisiana or french quarter .
0 my family ordered the bacon burger , chicken fingers , and a greek wrap .
0 no real kids menu .
0 the food was very tasty , waitress was very cordial .
0 the decor was pretty nice but the food left alot to be desired .
0 ok no biggie , but then came the food .
0 let me just get your drink orders . ''
0 i ordered seared ahi tuna salad .
0 even so , the service was adequate - nothing more , nothing less .
0 not very friendly and welcoming , just adequate .
0 sides are ordered separately ; we selected grilled asparagus and potato gratin .
0 the portions are quite generous but the presentation was way off for me .
0 the chunks of clay on the wall are interesting , i guess .
0 i liked the salad , but it was nothing special .
0 the consistency of the blue crab fondue was a little too runny .
0 the little copper pot it came in was cool though .
0 at $ _num_ , i was not impressed .
0 one more time she came out and honestly i was getting pissed off .
0 they had no baked potatoes .
0 so , i just asked her , what do you have .
0 mashed potatoes was my only choice .
0 for $ _num_ , they ca n't find i potato ?
0 the steak was served on top of the overly buttered mash potatoes .
0 i ate them , but nothing special .
0 after $ _num_ for _num_ people , i was not impressed .
0 as the website states , with asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes .
0 left in _num_ minutes and booked room across the street at la quinta .
0 wish i could have given red roof a quarter of a star .
0 do n't stay here .
0 it 's like they are trying to make the ghetto look classy .
0 my room was smoke free yet it reeked of smoke and a horrible smell .
0 i will never return to red roof in .
0 _num_ came and went and no shuttle .
0 the shuttle driver claimed he was never told about a _num_ pickup .
0 i would n't recommend at all parking your car there for the airport .
0 room does not look like hotels.com photos .
0 do not stay here .
0 probably the worst hotel ever .
0 something fishy is def going on here .
0 this is a standard gas station and not really worth reviewing .
0 she asks me what i ordered .
0 my sandwich was dripping with sauce and had everything on it !
0 she turned out to be the only pleasant person during my whole experience .
0 was the fourth car in line and have been sitting here for _num_ minutes .
0 now i wait at the menu with no response ... .
0 wo n't be back .
0 worst experience ever at a wendy 's !
0 my daughter 's drink order was wrong to start .

0 while we wait our fries are sitting on b the tray getting cold .
0 once we received our burgers one was wrong .
0 after getting it corrected my fries were then really cold .
0 i asked for ketchup and was handed _num_ packets .
0 avoid this location if you can .
0 every other experience there was nearly as bad .
0 my friend was transferred to this hospital from the south park emergency room .
0 they kept her there for _num_ nights which is unheard of .
0 they took a ct scan but we never received results , still have n't .
0 the nurse said nothing and just kept going .
0 i am not sure how someone thinks this food is great .
0 it is subpar and out of the freezer .
0 nothing is homemade and food is dry .
0 grocery stores are always open .
0 ( sigh ) ... so here 's why i 'll never shop here again .
0 so i 'm reading the back .
0 then i see it : `` this finished product not tested on animals . ''
0 and then i just got mad .
0 do they think we are idiots ?
0 excuse the rant , but this just really pissed me off .
0 restaurant had a horrible cleaned my smell as well .
0 worst service i have ever had two visits in a row .
0 our waiter was awful .
0 had to track down another server twice for drink refills and our check .
0 will not be back to that location !
0 but when it came out it just looked like a bowl of lard .
0 it also felt like i was eating a bowl of lard .
0 i should have probably ordered from the diet menu .
0 have n't had this bad of an experience in a while .
0 service was extremely slow .
0 hit and miss for lunch and summer .
0 pathetic , no other way to describe this brunch .

0 food : sub-par for your money .
0 free bread : none .
0 i felt like i was asking an enemy for a favor .
0 never use this place .
0 hard to believe how they stay in business .
0 i am very upset and disappointed with the service that i have received .
0 now , almost two weeks later , my order still has not arrived .
0 the customer service is not what i expected .
0 these books were needed last friday for a class that meets on mondays .
0 would n't go back .
0 but then he asks if he can see the earrings and necklace .
0 sadly that is n't the end .
0 i 've worked in the jewelry business , and i know what i like .
0 i was very clear in the preferences i stated .
0 you do n't tell a customer what to like .
0 oh but that 's not all folks .
0 if there were zero stars i would give that rating instead !
0 if there were zero stars i would give that rating instead !
0 anyway , we were dropping off three rings .
0 seriously , and it gets much worse .
0 and turn around and walk the hell out of there , seriously .
0 this is the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
0 not a way to gain a new customer !
0 my wife then confirmed her day off from work .
0 i 'd give this company zero stars if it were an option .
0 they came quickly - only three days from when we reported the problem .
0 when two weeks go by , i called to check in .
0 no one answered the phone during business hours .
0 neither of our messages were returned .
0 the worst customer service ever !
0 probably the least professional business i 've ever worked with .

0 first go around - not too bad .
0 the owner was beyond rude !
0 made many promises and failed to keep them .
0 claimed his repair guy was out of cell range all day .
0 very rude and unprofessional guy !
0 not willing to work out anything with the customer .
0 he did not even offer to make an appointment after his busy time .
0 would not recommend this company to anyone .
0 zero stars for this guy .
0 my home warranty company gave me the number to carolina appliance service .
0 i assume he was the owner because he said `` my company '' .
0 i will not be working with carolina appliance service again .
0 its consistent , bad service or lack there of .
0 well that 's sure different , way to waste money on that .
0 the store itself is fairly clean and generic .
0 there was no voicemail option .
0 i have never in my life encountered such awful customer service .
0 we will never use sam 's club again .
0 i am so sick of walmart and sam 's club associates .
0 both walmart and sam 's club need to learn valuable customer service .
0 customer service is a joke .
0 said something to manager and they did n't care .
0 completely ripped me off .
0 everything else is nasty .
0 go back to florida , they like it there .
0 bland bbq , bland chicken .
0 this location was kind of busy .
0 we still had not gotten any drinks and not placed an order .
0 when she came back and had nothing i gave up .
0 he knew he had issues , bad people and a huge problem .
0 i visited around lunch time and the food was not that good .
0 the entree was a dry .
0 i am sorry , but i wo n't be back .
0 i do n't know where to start .
0 god turned water into wine well i will never be back .
0 i drove past this place on almost a daily basis for a couple years .
0 when our food finally arrived it was a disappointment .
0 my brisket was completely dry , as was the cornbread .
0 the baked potato was overcooked and the beans super sweet with no smoke .
0 corn bread just taste bad .
0 it is n't worth it and is n't typical for the south .
0 do n't eat here !
0 so go thee instead .
0 i visited nc and thought this place was disgusting , i sure was right !
0 never ever going back .
0 my experiences have not been satisfactory at all .
0 save yourself the frustration !
0 i have never received worse customer service .
0 and she has been rude and nasty to me since .
0 i really could care less at the moment .
0 anyway , appointment starts and we go into separate room .
0 every vet i 've been to takes the temp through her ear .
0 it seemed a little rough .
0 do n't you do this all day ?
0 could n't you have told me to move ?
0 overall , kind of an irritating experience .
0 the staff did n't seem to `` get '' dogs .
0 i do not recommend south charlotte animal hospital .
0 i came in for my first visit and was very disappointed .
0 the nurse was very short with me .
0 what animal hospital does not stock those items ?
0 for an annual , the price was outrageous .
0 i will not be returning .
0 they did my cuticles so badly that i was bleeding a whole lot .
0 do n't bother making an appointment for this place .
0 that goes for the dated , smelly theater as well .
0 on this beautiful friday evening there was no ticket office open .
0 never fear , she sold us a ticket .
0 she poured me a _num_ oz pour and charged me around $ _num_ .
0 this theatre is dying , do n't waste your money .
0 this place is filthy and outdated .
0 the bathrooms are yuck and this whole place should be redone !
0 as for their food options , they 're not great .
0 that was _num_ minutes of my life that i 'd like back .
0 the food sucks and is way overpriced as is the souvenirs .
0 we had no problems using our admission ticket or parking ticket .
0 the snack was another problem .
0 - workers : rude , rude , rude .
0 are you kidding me ?
0 do n't buy your tickets online !
0 staffs are disrespectful and do n't want to help at all .
0 lines are short and fast because the place is near empty .
0 most we had to wait was _num_ minutes .
0 specific problem is the incredibly poor customer service attitude .
0 poor , poor customer service .
0 wow just really bad .
0 carowinds in my opinion is crap .
0 poor customer service in all parts of the park .
0 managers of the park know this and they dont do a thing about it .
0 carowinds for that they offer is not worth the drive or the money .
0 im done w this place .
0 first parking is a joke and a crime .
0 this is n't just for premium parking , but its for general too .
0 some of the bathrooms were really old and disgusting .
0 should have wait times listed for rides .
0 staff is n't polite or even nice for that matter .
0 park is n't very clean .
0 bathrooms are filthy and smell awful .
0 i would not recommend purchasing extras online .
0 only purchase the basic tickets .
0 we had a printed voucher that we paid for that was n't honored .
0 $ _num_ mistake ( _num_ people ) .
0 nowhere on the dinosaur tickets we purchased does it say anything about that time !
0 last saturday , i paid for my ticket and headed in .
0 - $ _num_ for chicken tenders and fries ?
0 no other entertainment was available while we were there .
0 wo n't make the _num_ hour drive again from charleston .
0 much better value for money spent .
0 saving up that six hundred bucks to go elsewhere .
0 park was beyond rude and unhelpful about it .
0 food is expensive and nasty .
0 when we finally got off after your employees gave zero communication .
0 it was a waste of my day time and money .
0 it 's sad when a park can only give you a drink for compensation .
0 however , it 's not worth it here .
0 it took one kid _num_ minutes to refill our drink .
0 it 's miserable . ''
0 carowinds has horrible line management .
0 on top of that , my boyfriend and i encountered the rudest staff there .
0 avoid this place if you have the option .
0 they should be closed down for good and removed from the park .
0 what is really bad is the food was horrible !
0 really , you do n't know the answer to that simple question ?
0 if i could give this place zero stars i would .
0 the customer service is atrocious .
0 ummm ... excuse me !
0 if anything goes wrong you 'll get the worst help ever .
0 i 'm very disappointed with the way carowinds is run .
0 all the employees were extremely rude and seemed to hate their jobs .
0 one employee yelled at me and my dad for nothing !
0 never have i had these problems at carowinds until this year !
0 so sad carowinds has become such a disappointment .
0 plus do n't even try complaining to guest services .
0 they could care less about your complaints and then tell you some bs excuse .
0 we sadly left with extreme disappointment !
0 i will not recommend anyone to go to the park .
0 will not go back to carowinds !
0 unfortunately , we recently had a very disappointing experience at carowinds .
0 the line was over three hours long .
0 it was not , it was also almost three hours long as well .
0 cindy , the manager on duty , was rude from the beginning .
0 she had no response and again told us we were essentially out of luck .
0 drove _num_ hours to get to the park .
0 still charging $ _num_ plus $ _num_ for parking .
0 i would definitely not take your family .
0 i would give _num_ stars if i could .
0 worst experience of my families life .
0 then tons of school kids were breaking lines and nothing being done .
0 check your credit and debit cards after use in carowinds !
0 kids and even adults were so annoyed and started cutting lines .
0 same with food , souvenirs and entrance tickets .
0 my husband and i just moved to charlotte and live about _num_ mins away .
0 we only spent maybe _num_ mins in that line .
0 then our day took a turn for the worse .
0 we did n't get to ride that .
0 do n't get excited like i did .
0 did n't see it till we had already taken drinks .
0 so , i am really really disappointed carowinds .
0 worst food ever got sick .
0 i been here before then said you can sit down now .
0 so these guys almost made me spend $ _num_ for unnecessary repairs .
0 the manager then pushed a full set of tires my way for $ _num_ .
0 for nothing i needed !
0 duke energy is the only electric company in town .
0 their customer service is terrible .
0 five days later i get a bill for three previous months !
0 they asked if i was sure i only moved in five days earlier .
0 the company is run by morons .
0 if you live in the area , i guess you have no choice .
0 duke energy pulled some really shady crap on us .
0 worst experience on the phone with customer service ever !
0 please do not support a place that sells puppy mill dogs .
0 i do not recommend going here .
0 i was searching for an independent little place to pick up dog food .
0 the woman in charge was downright rude .
0 please do not buy fish from this store they will rip you off .
0 nothing more ; nothing less .
0 it 's $ _num_ a head .
0 finally , no one takes credit cards ... even for the admission charge .
0 not a good mix .
0 on the week ends it is $ _num_ dollars .
0 should have only paid per ride .
0 do n't really remember it being so bad when i was younger lol .
0 felt like someone was holding my whole body down .
0 hot dog was not bad but nothing to write home about .
0 they did have a free petting zoo and horse ride was eight dollars .
0 i should have let my nephew finger paint my car instead .
0 the guy ( tom ) , acknowledged everything i was saying .
0 so i dropped it off for a week .
0 when i picked it up : _num_ .
0 they did n't even paint the roof .
0 no body work was done .
0 whatever you were thinking of getting done ... do n't do it there .
0 there is paint on the grill and damage from where the tape was removed .
0 both cars left the shop looking worse than they did when they entered .
0 customer service leaves much to be desired .
0 ridiculously overpriced for the finished product and experience .
0 saturday rolls around , no call .
0 the next week starts , still no call .
0 over _num_ hours after they say it 'll be ready .
0 entire car was dusty , inside and out .
0 truly the worst customer experience ever .
0 they do n't provide it because they do n't want you to find them .
0 but when i 'm on a budget i choose motel _num_ .
0 then to top it off the remote does n't even work for the tv .
0 no way to rate a _num_ !
0 the room smelled awful .
0 only _num_ towels for _num_ people !
0 even when we asked for more towels they said only _num_ per room .
0 _num_ battery in the tv remote and the phone did n't work .
0 i also wore my shoes in the shower because of how unsanitary it was !
0 this is probably the worst hotel i 've ever stayed in .
0 i was on a long trip from florida and stopped here for the night .
0 i wish i would have taken photos .
0 i have never been to a less taken care of establishment .
0 this hotel is old and poorly managed .
0 they have a sanitation rating of _num_ % .
0 when i got a refund the next day it was $ _num_ short !
0 why am i being charged for your mistakes ?
0 not nearly impossible , literally impossible .
0 my room reeked of mold and mildew .
0 the next room was worse .
0 i could not believe it .
0 on the 3rd floor , with no elevator in sight .
0 like stains from washing and not coming out of the sheets .
0 i had to flush like _num_ times for it to clear the bowl .
0 the water was very hard .
0 it got cold at night .
0 we could not leave it on while gone from the room .
0 the room itself was not too bad .
0 i would stay at a days inn again , but definitely not this one .
0 when i went in to discuss , i heard another patient checking in .
0 the doctor prescribed me medication that i am allergic to .
0 went on the visit and nothing was done .
0 they are lazy ass hell !
0 do n't waste your money or time .
0 find another place where the doctors care .
0 i do n't know what is happening to medicine patients appointments etc .
0 it makes me very unhappy .
0 there is a reason this location has such bad reviews .
0 the front desk staff is the worst i 've ever encountered .
0 everyone else obviously hates their job and could care less about your medical problems .
0 avoid uptown at all costs .
0 because _num_ is n't an option .
0 extremely poor customer service .
0 this is `` name brand '' prices for crap clothing .
0 and we went over by _num_ cent !
0 are you kidding me ?
0 pay less has better !
0 sometimes i guess expected good customer service is asking for too much .
0 this is just ridiculous .
0 unorganized store with a smaller selection than most old navy stores .
0 there were clothes all over the ground and nothing was folded .

0 to be fair , we knew it was pricey .
0 same with my ginger ale .
0 slow , slow , slow .
0 the food just was n't that great , and it was a bit pricey .
0 nothing wrong with paying up for great food , but blue was n't it .
0 however , based on previous reviews , the food is hit or miss .
0 my dinner there was a substantial miss for a pretty substantial price .
0 side note : the service was phenomenal , no problems in that department .
0 or if someone else is picking up the tab .
0 you can go out once and have no desire to ever go out again .
0 or you can fall in love and find reason to be back daily .
0 also , i did n't like the quality of the flatbread .
0 lobster cream sauce should never be flavorless !
0 the cake di chocolate is standard lava cake ( takes forever to make ) .
0 maybe if i come back next time i 'll have better luck ?
0 i am in boston , not charlotte .
0 i would never patronize a place like this .
0 if you do , be cautious -- do not give them your email .
0 ok , i 'm lying .
0 the service was atrocious and incredibly slow .
0 so the food is boxed and i come home , nightmare over , right ?
0 so nobody went home with their own food .
0 not quite horrible , but not quite good either .
0 edible is a better word for it .
0 sounds fancy , eh ?
0 manager : ( blank stare and walks away ) .
0 needless to say , i will never come back here again .

0 i preferred them over the duck .
0 for dessert , we ordered the cheesecake to split .
0 the food was decent .
0 service was absolutely horrible !
0 the young woman did not greet us in the most welcoming manner .
0 she looked as if she was forced to be there !
0 never asked us if we wanted another drink nor if are food was good !
0 it was very bizarre !
0 for such a nice atmosphere its too bad the service was horrible .
0 i rarely complain but i have never been treated sooo poorly .
0 sorry we picked it after reading rave reviews online .
0 would n't go back .
0 but not the place if you 're super hungry .
0 the most recent time i went i was very disappointed .
0 i do n't know that i 'll recommend my guests here any more .
0 all _num_ over prices and all _num_ just okay .
0 pop and they were down the hatch !
0 something tells me there is better seafood out there in charlotte .
0 what a disappointment , the risotto balls were very bland and gummy .
0 the only good thing was the lemon drop martini .
0 i am sorry to be writing this review .
0 my first visit to blue a few years ago was fabulous .
0 the calamari appetizer was good , but not worth $ _num_ .
0 the baked in house bread were blah , and butter was not offered .
0 but , this evening was an utter disappointment .
0 btw ... coffee was $ _num_ .
0 sorry , but i will not go back .
0 probably would not go back .
0 to be honest with you nothing really jumped off the menu to me .
0 i settled for the beef tenderloin and fried calamari appetizer .
0 i ordered medium-rare and it was purple , barely cooked in the middle .
0 simply put , it is overpriced and not worth your money .
0 went for a girls night for restaurant week .
0 he picked the risotto balls they were okay , kinda bland .
0 this was not a good steak .
0 the cookie was terrible !
0 do n't think i will be back .
0 disappointed in my queens feast choice .
0 wish i could go back and choose again .
0 i 'm a foodie and disappointed .
0 no vegan desert option for me ( fresh fruit option , please ?
0 it all seemed to disappear , though , so that says something !
0 still , i 'm not sure we will be back anytime soon .
0 after being seated , it took our waiter forever to come to our table .
0 what a bummer to spend that much money and be that underwhelmed .
0 reservation for _num_ on a saturday made with ease .
0 maybe a warning sign .
0 it was also very loud .
0 it kind of set me off for the rest of the meal .
0 the service was ok , but not great .
0 our waters were n't refilled but once .
0 i waffle between _num_ stars and _num_ .
0 this is a personal experience that stuck with me for years .
0 beyond that our waitress was rude .
0 here i am on yelp looking at queen 's feast and i see blue .
0 you might love this place but i had such a poor experience and follow-up .
0 this is a personal experience that stuck with me for years .
0 i consider a brunch with mom on mothers day ruined when mom is apologizing .
0 here i am on yelp looking at queen 's feast and i see blue .

0 the fruit was mediocre .
0 the salad was n't good .
0 the vegetable station was n't appealing .
0 the beef i got was so tough i could n't chew it .

0 we sure wish we had gone somewhere else .
0 i do n't think we will come here any time again too soon .
0 it 's a shame .
0 my husband ordered a whiskey sour and our friends and i ordered bloody marys .
0 i thought the menu had said tapas style for the table - my bad .
0 eventually i just gave up .
0 i asked for a cappuccino for dessert and was told the machine was broken .
0 i 'm just going to break this down into pros vs cons .
0 three half pours of wine for like $ _num_ .
0 if i ever go back to this restaurant i want approx .
0 _num_ orders of this .
0 ( this might be a pro to some ) boyfriend ordered their house cocktail .
0 he could n't drink it .
0 all in all , i promise you can find a better restaurant in charlotte .
0 did n't really care for the food here .
0 there are better restaurants to frequent .
0 blue could be great but it 's not .
0 there was only one sushi chef on duty .
0 owner was extremely polite .
0 waitress was not the best .
0 surely there are better places in town .
0 when they do deliver , it always takes longer than the estimated time .
0 there was no flavor at all .
0 having limited options in uptown i gave this place a few chances .
0 it 's just not good .
0 this is the worst sushi place in charlotte .
0 the website clearly stated the restaurant closed at 10pm .
0 all in all , it was def not my best groupon date night .
0 appetizers got there only _num_ minutes before main course , seriously ?
0 the kicker , the place was n't busy , not in the least bit .
0 i will never return here when i come back to charlotte .
0 worst chicken pad thai i 've ever had .
0 was sick to my stomach all afternoon .
0 of course , i 'm not sure it was really chicken .
0 the noodles were not good either .
0 worst experience of my life .
0 i did n't like it .
0 earlier this week i decided to order a rather large order to be delivered .
0 the waiter never did refill my water glass .
0 felt rushed even though other tables were available .
0 my wife has made multiple phone calls only to have one returned .
0 i have never seen such a horrible community college in my life time .
0 i do n't think i 've had a positive experience yet .
0 you 're better off going in to speak to someone face to face .
0 do not waste your time here .
0 you 're better off taking your money elsewhere .
0 i gave one star because you ca n't give none !
0 do n't go for the jerk chicken .
0 i would try something else ... if i go back .
0 i was sooo very disappointed .
0 but i always prefer vegetarian and i 've had much much better food elsewhere .
0 as far as veggies goes , not tasty is for sure .
0 you get a lot of food but its kind of expensive for lunch .
0 plates that are old and worn .
0 it 's sad to see a small business that just does n't get it .
0 will not go back .
0 if i could give this place zero stars i would .
0 very dirty and disgusting .
0 sat down and he brought out egg noodles and duck sauce .
0 got up and walked out .
0 i wish zero stars were an option .
0 i ate a few bites and tossed most of it in the trash .
0 there were no other diners in the restaurant .
0 we ordered the szechuan shrimp and scallops and also the shrimp in garlic sauce .
0 the place appears dirty , the service is not friendly .
0 did n't seem to care about having sit-down customers at all .
0 just a bad experience all around .
0 but i 'm not going to anymore .
0 they simply ca n't get the orders right .
0 tonight was the last straw .
0 never ordering from this place again .
0 this is a trash and security problem .
0 `` me never come back here '' .
0 the food here used to be good now it 's trash .
0 pay for extras that you do n't get when ordering in .
0 was really disappointed about that .
0 first of all , the customer service was great !
0 however , my jaw almost hit the floor when we received our bill .
0 our total bill was almost $ _num_ .
0 i did not feel that the dry cleaning was worth that much .
0 i would recommend others to check the price when you drop off your clothes .
0 worst auto bell in town .
0 it was n't even decent enough for one star .
0 however the content was way too old for my _num_ yr old .
0 also , what kind of a market does n't have bread you can buy ?
0 literally , the entire store , no bread !
0 monday you did n't have meat .
0 what kind of deli runs out of meat and white bread ?
0 problem is , there wo n't be a next time .
0 i try to be fair ... but after _num_ strikes .
0 i would strongly advise anyone seeking a quality landscaping contractor to look elsewhere .
0 i called to say i was going to be ten minutes late .
0 smells gross all the time , small portions for a hella large price tag .
0 spend your money eating something w personality !
0 and the service last time i came was horrible !
0 the younger girl did them and did a bad job .
0 she made an excuse that the brush was too big .
0 she did n't ask me , she told me to come back tomorrow .
0 there is no tomorrow .
0 i will not go back !
0 he never responded to my call for repairs .
0 maybe my standards are too high .
0 i had a chicken biscuit , and the boyfriend had egg and bacon .
0 but the biscuits just do n't cut it for me to try them again .
0 the flavorless meat drowned in sauce is not acceptable for any real barbecue lover .
0 i felt like i was robbed .
0 but it just fails to deliver too often .
0 to be honest , that sealed the deal for me .
0 the food just does n't measure up to that kind of poor customer service .
0 once again , the nurse 's attitude was inexcusable .
0 long review , but i felt strongly enough that i wanted to post .
0 she cut me off every time i started to speak .
0 you do not know the specific circumstances surrounding my situation .
0 i was so glad it was over .
0 this place just made me feel so uncomfortable .
0 do not go here , it 's an utter disgrace .
0 no bed side manor .
0 horrible experience and expensive .
0 in my opinion they could not possibly be legit recommendations .
0 it 's generic , it 's dull , and it 's over rated .
0 if they had not i would have left .
0 the pizza , the calamari , the pasta .
0 my husband and i ate here this evening .
0 we were seated promptly without a reservation and the waiter quickly took our order .
0 the server brought some cold , salty garlic rolls .
0 my ravioli was barely cooked .
0 that , like i said , i give up .
0 i could not agree more that this is so funny .
0 just plain salty and awful .
0 they kept the beer and wine flowing at our table at every visit .
0 the crust was bland and the filling seemed sparse .
0 i was underwhelmed but my coworkers raved about their dishes .
0 the bread was already soggy like it had been sitting for a bit .
0 my friend had calamari that she did n't care for at all .
0 with grilled veggies and mashed potatoes .
0 leftovers are in my future .
0 still , i was n't blown away by it .
0 i was mildly annoyed because i do n't think she even acknowledged my presence .
0 i do n't see a return in my future .
0 goat cheese - this was without a doubt my favorite of anything all night .
0 it was good but nothing to rave about .
0 y'all clearly have never eaten outside of charlotte .
0 both times ive had the penne alla vodka , once again its pretty mediocre .
0 when i say frequent , i mean every friday .
0 like one reviewer below mentioned , this is just a step above olive garden .
0 i have been to italy and this food is nowhere near `` authentic . ''
0 i 'm not sure why this restaurant gets such a high rating .
0 i was rather disappointed in most aspects .
0 the pasta was also overcooked .
0 this place did n't have the authentic taste i was looking for .
0 the atmosphere is nice but the food quality was lacking .
0 totally not worth it .
0 we used to really like their lasagna and pizza .
0 even the rolls were almost stale .
0 guess i will stick to a salad , appetizers and bread pudding .
0 maybe i 'm weird .
0 but it seems like recently , everything at mama 's is over seasoned .
0 one time recently the server was really inattentive .
0 i took my mom out for her birthday and we left disappointed .
0 i do n't know why this chef would completely change the perfected dish .
0 i had a pizza and it was quite bland .
0 the food here was just adequate .
0 the waiter said they get really busy so they bring the check first .
0 we then said : it tastes like peanut butter and she replied : really ?
0 but does n't nutella tastes like peanut butter to you ?
0 the last few times out experience was just fair .
0 they did accommodate us after my request to put _num_ tables together .
0 it really was n't her fault that the food was awful !
0 it was pretty average italian food , nothing to write home about .
0 the bread they bring to the table before dinner was n't very good .
0 i ordered the cheese ravioli and added two meatballs .
0 shrimp is either cooked or it 's not .
0 incredibly bad management and ownership .
0 i know where i am not welcome .
0 i guess i do n't really have a choice .
0 i got the penne ala vodka without prosciutto because i do n't eat meat .
0 i was very disappointed !
0 they were apologetic when they finally realized my meal was n't touched .
0 it was much better than the spicy pasta .
0 in buffalo , we like a little pasta with our sauce .
0 took money out of my account for late fees .
0 never notified me , never called nothing .
0 ca n't wait to go back !
0 worse customer service i have received in quite awhile .
0 sorry i bothered you from sitting on your *** .
0 suggestions , maybe do a little housekeeping .
0 too bad i ca n't give no stars .
0 will not return ever .
0 i used to frequent v cleaners & alterations .
0 so from that day forward , i started to patronize them less .
0 i started referring other people here but i will stop the referrals immediately .
0 plus the quality is not great and never replace buttons when broken .
0 i will find a more customer oriented business that appreciates customers .
0 we had film developed and the outcome was very poor .
0 charged for _num_ and only did _num_ .
0 dishonest , poor quality and bad attitude .
0 i do n't see how they could possibly have any repeat business .
0 i had an emergency on the morning i was leaving for europe .
0 i even questioned it because i said it did n't look right .
0 when i returned to grab the photos , they were horrible quality .
0 ( this was a different , older man btw ) .

0 i travel to clt fairly regular on business .
0 waitstaff was not helpful with the menu .
0 the food was mediocre at best .
0 if you really want great indian food ... go to copper .
0 it 's all about curries , rice , naan and spices .
0 would i eat here again if i 'm in the area ?
0 time to find a better indian place , i 'm afraid .
0 i 'd adventure elsewhere to indian if i were you .
0 i really want to love this restaurant but i really do n't .
0 sadly , both experiences were less than stellar .

0 this was the worst indian i 've had in charlotte .
0 i now know why this place is always empty .
0 the spice was horrible .
0 all bland , boring curries and an always empty naan bin .
0 someone needs to wake up , update , and start cooking with passion .
0 life is too short .
0 none of the items were cooked properly .
0 wo n't be back .
0 the customer service however has been lacking each and every time .
0 the standard is appalling .
0 he then proceeded to tell me that he only offer _num_ % .

0 food was mediocre and the waiter should not be working in he service industry .
0 they had been our favorite for years .
0 every item of food was really unimpressive .
0 but it turned out to be a real bad experience .
0 even all other orders were very well below average .
0 my hibachi shrimp was very hard and tough as well .
0 the veggies were the only high spot .
0 the brown rice was mushy .
0 over _num_ % of the class failed the final .
0 do not waste your money .
0 they dont go over the math which is a big part of the test .
0 it does n't get any worse than this !
0 it was clear all she cared about was bringing me to the cleaners .
0 i could go on for hours but it 's not worth it .
0 the food was to die for and the service was perfection .
0 however getting a quote and information from them was beyond frustrating !
0 i submitted a request online , a week went by and i heard nothing .
0 right off the bat she said `` no . ''
0 after a brief hold , she came back and said `` no . ''
0 i did n't find all of the staff to be overly professional .
0 nonetheless , filing taxes is a necessary evil .

0 : ( i 'll buy online before i go in here again .
0 the chicken parm sub i ordered was a hot bland mess .
0 the roll was cold like it was just pulled out of a bag .

0 `` i 'm sorry , we close at six . ''
0 `` oh no , it 's after six ?
0 as i walked away , i looked at my phone .
0 i was turned away , despite the obviously urgent situation .

0 unfortunate because i would have enjoyed trying it !
0 run , do not walk away from this place .
0 unless you do n't mind paying a fortune .
0 do n't trust them with anything you want to keep .
0 first and last time i will be going to jones dry cleaning .
0 do yourself a favor and go to quail dry cleaners next door .
0 after taking one bite i 'm less than satisfied .
0 it 's cold and completely unimpressive .
0 there are far too many better pizza places to indulge in .
0 this is not a review about papa johns in general .
0 go to domino 's if this is your papa johns for your area .
0 this place is awful do n't trust them .
0 honestly , this is the worst food i 've ever purchased .
0 flavorless , undercooked , and late .
0 had to sign up just to inform others not to waste their money .

0 no stars and no more business from us !
0 the french fries are ok , i guess .
0 i wo n't be going back .
0 very slow `` servers '' .
0 the bald manager is not a very nice person also .
0 the parking lot is small , barely wide enough to get your care into .
0 when i questioned the cashier she did n't apologize or anything .
0 tipping should be up to the customer , not the cashier !
0 at this point i ca n't even get a return call .
0 not sure if this was fixed or not .
0 we also got the standard egg rolls and crab rangoon .
0 i mean , c'mon , it 's veggie lo mein !
0 the cherry special chicken , however , was pretty darn tasty .
0 overly sweet and not so appetizing .
0 good chinese takeout here , seems to be hard to find .
0 nothing to rave about , but not terrible either .
0 i was very disappointed .
0 i will be getting my chinese food elsewhere .
0 the coupon was spend _num_ , get _num_ off .
0 in any case , i was a little let down .
0 i 've had worse .
0 my cookie had no fortune .
0 it 's really like eating fired dough with cherry jelly stuff ... nasty .
0 and the beef with broccoli was worse !
0 on second though i think my cafeteria was better .
0 it was just so gross id rather have just ordered pizza .
0 seriously , do n't go here .
0 con : they ca n't get the online orders right .
0 i even asked for low salt , low sugar , and low msg .
0 con : they reheated the same food they 'd made earlier for me .
0 rice and the veggies i got were no problem .
0 but i was also delivered some super soggy crab rangoon .
0 con : i really do n't think i 'll be ordering from them again .
0 nothing to write home about and pretty expensive .

0 i will not be ordering from here again .
0 this place has really fallen off .

0 it has gone downhill .
0 it 's the only place i order my chinese takeout from .
0 mine did n't show up in my delivery order .
0 neither was spicy at all .
0 what i do n't like is they often forget to give you rice .
0 it was theory tasteless love me in i 've ever eaten .
0 boiled pasta would have had more flavor .
0 this would n't really bother me much if the food was better .
0 crystal clear and the music sounded like a million bucks coming out of it .
0 , the beers are cheap and cold .
0 anyway , we had to purchase more tickets at the door .
0 guess the best advice , just pay at door .
0 oh and last thing that should n't be over looked , the shower .
0 so you ask why _num_ stars , simple it was location location .
0 they 're out of bacon , yes bacon !
0 the ham was cold and salty and the turkey was like bad deli meat .
0 needless to say , i wo n't be returning .
0 my husband and i stayed here as a weekend get away to charlotte .
0 we would n't have been able to sleep in even if we wanted to .
0 the worst part was the water in the shower never got hot .
0 there is nothing worse than a lukewarm shower .
0 but my praise begins and ends there .
0 not even open on saturday mornings ?
0 _num_ years of loyalty mean nothing if you are laid off .
0 some of the worst chinese take out i 've had in a long time .
0 the chicken was overly breaded and very soggy .
0 it was very cheap - but i guess you get what you pay for .
0 and followed up with `` why would n't you pay for this ? ''
0 crab rangoon was terrible .
0 also ordered beef & mixed vegetable , meh .
0 my first & second experience here were both the same -- horrible .
0 i was horrified - however did not know where else to go .
0 the worst pizza hut ever .
0 stayed on hold for _num_ mins trying to change an order .
0 customer service is awful i wo n't be eating here ever again !
0 i received no apologies or explanation as to why it took so long .
0 do not go to this one .
0 this pizza hut is quite possibly the worst service i have ever received .
0 what type of pizza could possibly take over two hours ?
0 this type of service is just completely unacceptable .
0 wrong pizza was delivered .
0 this location has the worst service .
0 my entree , the scallops served with risotto , was fine but overpriced .
0 for $ _num_ i received three scallops on a bed of risotto .
0 was n't memorable , exciting or impressive .
0 i can not believe this place exists !
0 seriously , the youngest person there was in their early _num_ 's .
0 avoid at all costs !
0 we tried it again tonight for our anniversary dinner .
0 the descriptions were nice but the food did n't live up to it .
0 not worth the money .
0 why ca n't employees act kind to those who are dining in their home ?
0 the ravioli app was cold and tasteless .
0 unfortunately we found it to be a bit of a miss .
0 when we walked in the restaurant decor seems dated , or perhaps just generic .
0 we split the chopped salad with gorgonzola .
0 i dunno - just not that great and i wo n't go back .
0 while everything was decent , nothing really came together .
0 interesting old house feel to the place .
0 i had to put some hot sauce on there just to get a kick .
0 the hot sauce bottles were empty and dirty .
0 this is not authentic cajun food !
0 this has got to be the most overrated restaurant in charlotte .
0 i 've been _num_ times and i have never been impressed .
0 but this last time was horrible .
0 every dish we had was completely flavorless .
0 fortunately it was only half price because of the groupon that i used .
0 maybe it 's because people have never had real cajun cuisine before .
0 the fried green tomatoes were blah .
0 the batter was n't tasty at all .
0 my entree was the combo etouffee with shrimp , chicken and crawfish .
0 the seasoning was weak .
0 the portions were good .
0 neither one of my two friends finished their plates .
0 i will not be going back .
0 parking was hard to find and it was loud inside .
0 but not a good group night .
0 i do not understand the hype about this place .
0 everything is incredibly overpriced and the food is less than mediocre .
0 i did enjoy the bbq shrimp app but the entrees were miserable .
0 thank god i only went bc i had a groupon .
0 this was our first visit to this restaurant .
0 however this dish ( cajun platter ) lacked any type of cajun spices .
0 gumbo was a bit watery and a pinch of salt would n't have hurt .
0 my fiance and i went to cajun queen one night as a date night .
0 i was not impressed by the food nor the ambiance .
0 the food was spicy not flavorful , just spicy .
0 needless , to say not a great experience .
0 i would n't return or recommend this place .
0 they lack favor in their food .
0 it was not good .
0 visiting charlotte from los angeles while husband is in town for business .
0 not the shrimp , the sauce with bread dipped in .
0 the bad : food is mediocre .
0 but it was bland and the rice seemed undercooked and flavorless .
0 the final insult : the grits .
0 so incredibly let down by this dining experience .
0 meanwhile , the food was terrible .
0 how does one mess up a cookie pie ?
0 do not waste your money !
0 it was n't awful , but it was n't anything special .
0 the seasoning certainly did not taste cajun to me .
0 ( i got the crawfish creole and my girlfriend had the chicken etouffee . )
0 bottom line : i will not be going back .
0 very loud , bad service , and the food does n't met the expectations .
0 dirty plates were sitting in our table for a long time .
0 the owner could care less about customers .
0 nothing cajun about it .
0 they did not use our groupon correctly .
0 save your money and dine elsewhere .
0 i 'm not sure why this place is rated _num_ stars .
0 the food is barely ok .
0 the gumbo taste watered down and the service sucks to the 10th degree !
0 she came back _num_ min later .
0 do n't waste your time .
0 go to a better cajun restaurant , this one is not worth your money .
0 cajun queen was n't awful , but it was n't great either .
0 while not on par with new orleans , it 's not without charm .
0 still , not the big easy .
0 _num_ - new orleans .
0 very dissatisfied and disappointed .
0 will not go back .
0 went over year ago and was disappointed in the shrimp and grits .
0 this time , gave another shot and tried oysters and shrimp .
0 the side house salad we ordered for an additional $ _num_ was awful .
0 there were romaine core in the salad and one slice of cucumber .
0 the waiter was loud and annoying and our drinks ran out several times .
0 the past three times have been very disappointing !
0 either way i will not go back .
0 the staff is unfriendly and rude .
0 so of course , i refused it .
0 trying cajun yard dog next .
0 if that 's a bust , so much for cajun in charlotte .
0 a friendly restaurant employee is the exception to the rule at cajun queen .
0 watery gumbo started off our meals .
0 no one finished their meal .
0 only one person even bothered to take home their leftovers .
0 i will definitely not visit this place ever again .
0 maybe it was the awful dinner spot they put my husband and i at .
0 we were next to the kitchen and it was really loud .
0 my husband got the chicken shrimp diane .
0 when it came , it was mushy and had the consistency of baby food .
0 i 've never had pecan pie like this texture before .
0 this place is awful !
0 was with friends for a birthday and it was _num_ degrees outside that night .
0 the reservation was for _num_ and _num_ of us got there first .

0 fried green tomatoes were good .
0 bbq shrimp were fine .
0 i 'll never return again .
0 reservations at 5:30 on a saturday and it was packed .
0 creole tasted like a can of crushed tomatoes .
0 it was just embarrassing to new orleans .
0 we ate there some time ago but they just threw three strikes for us .
0 i did n't even bother going on .
0 downstairs tables are too close .
0 even the rolls sucked ; very dry and tasteless .
0 me and my spouse order the same thing every time .
0 i believe he is the manager and is n't the most friendly manger .
0 leadership in these places however are what make your business .
0 then change how you handle your customers .
0 i 'm constantly amazed by how rude the receptionists are .
0 i had high hopes for the quality but i was disappointed .
0 mac and cheese boring , bland , no flavor .
0 cake dry boring i dont believe it was home made .
0 i stopped by the chicken box to grab lunch today .
0 the real shame is that they obviously changed the fried chicken recipe .
0 does anyone know where the old managers went ?
0 this new chicken box cafe is terrible .
0 this is no longer the chicken box cafe .
0 old owners or new owners , it was n't very good .
0 the fried chicken was n't crispy or seasoned like before .
0 it was empty when i arrived around _num_ pm .
0 my mother , daughter and i went here last week .
0 waited _num_ minutes for rice and gravy and got a refund .
0 it was ready within seven minutes or so , not bad at all .
0 wow , how rude !
0 do n't go here you will get ripped off !
0 as i was walking in i noticed a sign stating estimates were $ _num_ .
0 apparently they do n't have a lot of confidence that their prices are competitive .
0 umm , are n't dealerships supposed to be the highest ?
0 i hate to admit this but this is not first accident .
0 oh and you have to put _num_ % upfront .
0 i 've never been treated like this .
0 do n't fall for it there 's too many options !
0 so , i went with a staple dish , vegetable lo mein .
0 was really rude when i followed up on one question .
0 their work is shoddy and inconsistent at best .
0 even after constant complaints , this company has continued to deliver sub-par service .
0 only if you are from chicago and you prepared it .
0 but it was a mixed rack ... .
0 mac & cheese : so , so .
0 two words ... ... keep driving !
0 they do n't keep fresh food out like they should for the drivers .
0 did n't trust the hygiene of it based on the rest of site .
0 this place is disgusting !
0 the bathrooms are horrible and the coffee stations are nasty .
0 if the bathrooms are bad i will never buy coffee or food .
0 food came correctly and my iced coffee was bomb !
0 no , my sign was you just walking away , lol wow .
0 oh well , ca n't win them all i suppose .
0 the food is ok but the service is awful .
0 absolutely the worst service ( if you can call it that ) .
0 you just get in your car and drive .
0 we were like , whoa , where the heck did that come from .
0 that 's what ruined the racing experience . )
0 customer service was seriously lacking .
0 i just did n't feel welcomed .
0 i 'm barely decent on the track but geez .
0 hopefully i get a better experience next time .
0 this was possibly the worst experience i have ever had as a parent .
0 we went to have a snack and wait til the next round .
0 if i could give zero stars i would .
0 the `` move over '' sign is utterly ridiculous .
0 i have zero problem moving over in order to allow faster drivers to pass .
0 two of us were forced to go the next round .
0 on a positive note , saturday is half off on ladies night .
0 first of all , it is in a sketchy part of charlotte .
0 however , it was very deceiving because the customer service was not good .
0 little did i know , that race was starting in five minutes !
0 apparently , the adult races run every hour .
0 well , they could n't help me with that either .
0 i really did n't want come back here though .
0 if it was n't for the price , then i would not even bother .
0 furthermore , i would rather drive _num_ minutes more to concord to race there .
0 they should just say its a flat rate charge .
0 outdated for the volume of traffic handled .
0 we did n't move for an hour and a half .
0 `` could be _num_ .
0 i repeat , this is a station review !
0 that 's a problem for another review .
0 and it is ugly .
0 staff are totally rude .
0 no southern hospitality whatsoever .
0 if you take a train out of here , have someone drop you off .
0 besides the limited parking , i would not want to leave my car here .
0 so , two weeks roll around and we head out to noda .
0 she asks my husband to reschedule .
0 monday , no phone call all day .
0 for my third tattoo , i decided i wanted to go to fu 's .
0 spent almost $ _num_ on a custom tattoo i found online that i wanted .
0 would not go back and would not recommend to anyone .
0 i wo n't go here ever again because of the poor service .
0 none to be had here !
0 please do not waste your time , gas or money .
0 really , not an apology or let me get the manager .
0 holes burned in comforter .
0 stayed one night in _num_ bedroom unit .
0 he slept on the sofa both nights .
0 for me , who was paying the bill ... not ok .
0 for being a hilton i was n't too impressed !
0 i do not understand why this place gets any business at all .
0 both the cashier and the owner would not give me their names .
0 do n't waste your time or money .
0 i wish i could give a minus _num_ .
0 he was the rudest , most ignorant employee i encountered in the entire airport .
0 only if you 're lucky though .
0 i did not have a great experience in this airport .
0 it 's tough to be a vegetarian in nc , i guess .
0 anywhere remotely healthy or yummy looking had an insane line .

0 one of my least favorite airports .
0 honestly wish i could give it zero stars based on today ... ?
0 security is beyond the worst .
0 check in with the airline was smooth , thats about it .
0 i could n't help myself .
0 this is the worst airport layout ever .
0 this service should have included four star dining and drinks before hand .
0 to me , these are the airport 's only redeeming qualities .
0 tsa security is the worst .
0 no help , no smiles , to slow , do n't care .
0 generally a dirty airport ( delta terminal ) .
0 go to a bathroom that 's not serviced by these greedy people .
0 clt needs improvements in the drop off and pick up areas .
0 there was a very angry woman who came running and yelled at everyone .
0 she made them all get back out of lines and walk to the end .
0 she then forced them to walk through each empty section of the line .
0 and if it is , it is the worst nightclub airport in the world .
0 please do yourself a favor and avoid this airport .
0 charlotte ... could suck less but there are some things they are doing ok .
0 some of the walkways seem narrow but that could be just me .
0 i 'm not sure which is the worse nightmare .
0 must have been standing there for at least _num_ minutes .
0 this airport has ridiculously long lines .
0 for some reason , i found this airport to be kind of depressing .
0 i 've only been here once , so i would n't know .
0 there are many dining and drinking options , and cool rocking chairs .
0 very outdated , and super crowded .
0 this airport is just kinda weird .
0 when i got through , i had to go through security again .
0 your free wi-fi is totally useless .
0 internet is free but outdated .
0 slow and hard to get on .
0 it will only get worse .
0 the two stars are bonus points , but it gets the basics wrong .
0 that 's a deal breaker for me .
0 security checks are here to stay , do something about it .
0 - tsa agents are often rude and overly aggressive .
0 - not enough airlines service charlotte or compete for its business .
0 - not enough direct flights in or out .
0 long term parking lot was way over crowded .

0 i ended up driving back to the hertz lot and dropping off my car .
0 the rental buses are relatively quick but the guy that was driving -- suck !
0 the us airways terminal was packed as usual , i expect no less .
0 little did she know i know what the hell i 'm doing .
0 i 've only been traveling all of my life .
0 i get through security and notice the tight space of this terminal .
0 why do they have no tram ?
0 at other airports , the gates are in close proximity .
0 except all of them were yelling over each other .
0 so help me god , i do n't care .
0 i do n't feel bad .
0 for some reason i always have to connect between terminal e and terminal a .
0 i hate hate hate hate hate this airport , because i hate us air .

0 not a terrible experience but not an amazing one .
0 i like lax as my favorite airport .
0 i did n't check in so i have never waited in line at tsa .
0 it restaurants are over prices for a state that ends in carolina .
0 and the seats are certainly not designed for sleeping .
0 we officially hate charlotte .
0 everyone who works in this airport is miserable .
0 so it has made us assume that everyone in charlotte must be as well .
0 every place i 've eaten here is horrible .
0 as usual , the moving walkways are n't working either .
0 the food options are spread out , expensive , and impersonal .
0 this airport is not the best .

0 i had trouble finding a seat since most had trash or were dirty .
0 she can walk , but not fast , and not far .

0 poor , poor presentation .
0 i tasted the pizza and the crust was undercooked and burnt on the edges .
0 obviously the oven was too hot .
0 i wo n't be back again .
0 unfortunately being a charlotte institution does not mean tasty food .

0 the slaw was also minced rather than being shredded .
0 the pork was moist and tender , but very bland .
0 there was no smoke flavor at all .
0 the slaw was crunchy and fresh , but it too was bland .
0 but the pork although being tender and moist was disappointing .
0 overall it was n't a bad meal , but it was n't good either .
0 showed up to the ghetto as expected , but the meal was underwhelming .
0 did it , wo n't do it again .
0 he does not know everything .
0 nothing special about anything , imo .
0 not the worlds greatest bbq chicken ( sorry guy ) .
0 second price got soggy and the crust is only good when crisp .

0 , but i let him come and do at least the outside work .
0 after another _num_ minutes on hold , i hung up .
0 so frustrated with at & t 's horrible service !
0 something as simple as this still has not happened .
0 first of all , if i could i would n't give them any stars !
0 like i 'm supposed to be comfortable with that .
0 she finds anything to charge you to get extra money out of you .
0 prepare for the worst when you move over there .
0 the wings came out wings , but lacked any sort of taste in it .
0 i guess it was cheap .
0 it came with _num_ rolls , but they only gave us _num_ .

0 it is very isolated with not much within walking distance .
0 the location and staff gives off bad vibes .

0 they have the worst customer service i have ever received in life .
0 i took my prescription to another vendor and had my glasses made .
0 i could not see anything .
0 waited for _num_ mins past appointment time .
0 no respect for patients time .
0 the guy does n't know what he is doing .

0 the sprite is all soda no syrup .
0 the food was horrible both times i ate there in the past two weeks !
0 the workers are just plain rude .

0 they are hire incompetent morons .
0 they are hire incompetent morons .
0 so , i decided to go with _num_ hotcakes .
0 extremely disappointed with this company .
0 i found a property online that i fell in love with .
0 i was not only disappointed , but frustrated and angry .
0 this is not the way to treat potential customers and just people in general .
0 not pleased at all with their professionalism .
0 for the inside dining experience , mcdonald 's beats burger king , hands down .
0 new , clean but horrible service .
0 waited _num_ minutes for two breakfast sandwiches .
0 however , the food is definitely meh .
0 fries were a little soggy .
0 breakfast gets a _num_ , dinner gets a _num_ .
0 this is n't the first time either .
0 dry chicken , bland help , yay it 's southpark .
0 so she got me the street side tacos for me to munch on .
0 it was bland , nothing special at all .
0 but i suspect the rest of the food are blah too .
0 the same owner 's mimosa grill in uptown charlotte is much better .
0 really not much to say .
0 also $ _num_ beers of which i 've had about _num_ .
0 i will not be going back any time soon .
0 unfortunately , i found little to eat for lunch yesterday .
0 i have only been 2x 's within a year and was a little disappointed .
0 i just went for dinner and ordered the honey mustard glazed salmon .
0 it was ok but nothing special for $ _num_ .
0 probably would not go again .
0 sorry , the food was just horrible .
0 but with each experience , i am less impressed .
0 however , there are better places to dine within the southpark area .
0 the food is moderately priced , but is too much for what you get .
0 my last gripe with the restaurant is the limited menu .
0 this use to be the go to place because the food was always consistent .
0 flash forward to now , the tasty grilled portobello sandwich is gone .
0 what was left was less than 1/2 pound .
0 this place is as bland as they get .
0 the food was mediocre and the atmosphere was too .
0 i was so sad .
0 so in short the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down .
0 will not be going back .
0 our waitress was absolutely horrible .
0 to put it short , they should have just sent her home .
0 as for the food , it was bland , not much flavor .
0 this particular location is pretty hit or miss .
0 just is n't the same , maybe they sold ?
0 _num_ stars only because the service was good .
0 apparently a tuesday night is busy for the manager ( not the hostess ) .
0 tough and chewy , and the dull knife was not helping out .
0 the loaded baked potato was delicious .
0 i would n't bother to order it again .
0 and their garlic dressing is disgusting .
0 i do n't know why i continue to come here .
0 i dine here frequently and tonight was a real disappointment !
0 quality has went down as the price went up .
0 not worth going so much anymore .
0 that 's highly disgusting .
0 would never return if it was n't close and had to bring clients there .
0 i was very unimpressed .
0 soggy chips with a good steak .
0 i ordered the flat iron steak , which came smothered in a spicy sauce .
0 looks like we will stick with flying biscuit !
0 ca n't go wrong there .
0 if you like horseradish go for it , if not stay away .
0 i then chose the cheese and peppers omelette , with egg whites .
0 lindsay informed me they do n't offer egg whites , really ?
0 after ten minutes my waitress returned and informed me they could do egg whites .
0 so , i chose the omelette .
0 so , tonight we ordered two linguini and meatballs to go .
0 barely ate any of either serving .
0 we will probably be back , but only after the menu offers better fare .
0 pretty poor experience here .
0 nothing special and fairly expensive for what it was .
0 the waiter was very young and a bit clueless .
0 the food was good but the shrimp and grits are not good .
0 that was _num_ mins ago !
0 is this your corporate policy or just an issue with your provider ?
0 avoid at all costs if possible .

0 she was very helpful and knowledgeable .

0 closes before _num_ pm and locked the doors as i walked up .
0 is it me or does the customer service suck ?
0 this place seems like the opposite .
0 the chicken salad is made with turkey .
0 there was 1/4 lb .
0 i do not want to eat a cheesesteak with a fork and knife .
0 i do n't like a sandwich with more mayo than meat , either .
0 i will not return to this place .
0 but i figured why not maybe they ordered the wrong thing .
0 so , i ordered the chicken cheesesteak , fries and some coleslaw .
0 this is not authentic if that is what you are looking for .
0 the cheesesteak was soggy .
0 not as crispy as others stated and they needed salt !
0 i did n't eat them all because they got cold and kind of gross .
0 how long should it take to make a grilled cheese ?
0 the paper tickets are so _num_ 's .

0 folks , stay away from this place .
0 the patient is not seen as an equal partner .
0 after the 7th time being pushed away , i am taking my business elsewhere .
0 very hurt and upset with this business .
0 they could n't find any problem .
0 i 've filled tires 2x since so i asked them to check on tires .
0 no response to my concerns .
0 that , to me , says a lot about their skill level .
0 the apartments were great _num_ years ago , now not so much .
0 it 's been like this for the last _num_ months .
0 _num_ months later they still have not repaired my oven .
0 the leasing office is racist .
0 i would never recommend living here .
0 rude staff , shitty attitudes and unprofessional .
0 it is christmas and i still do n't have it .
0 thanksgiving and christmas ruined by these jerks because i have no seating .
0 no help at all .
0 after two weeks i emailed again ( _num_ times ) and was ignored .
0 do not buy anything from this company if you live out of state .
0 it 's very dated and in need of remodeling .
0 there is only one small public restroom and no organization to the layout .
0 there is no security cameras in the parking lot .
0 then a few staffing changes , and things started going downhill .
0 things went from okay to a little worse to absolutely horrible .
0 yeah this place is horrible .
0 waste and pet waste all over .
0 the pool is never clean .
0 the hot tub does n't work .
0 it really just is a crap place to live .
0 lived there for almost _num_ years , at the very back if it matters .
0 my car was almost stolen once even with an alarm on it ?
0 if you ever have a problem you are seriously sol .
0 especially for a single lady i would seriously avoid .
0 one last thing , their maintenance guys are f ; in creepy !
0 i hated the fact these guys actually had a key to my apt .
0 and i 'd come home randomly and find them there for no apparent reason .
0 food tasted ok and was brought out really quick , hence the _num_ stars .
0 if my simple needs can not be met , then i become very disappointed .
0 this is where yelping has become my source of self help .
0 our mild salsa never arrived .
0 this was the first sign that it was going to be an interesting night .
0 no mild salsa , no rice ... ... why bother !
0 sure i will be back , but with lower expectations .
0 gross as it was , i understand that mistakes happen .
0 i was disappointed after reading all the positive reviews .
0 the chicken and beef had no seasoning that i could taste at all .
0 the refried beans was like sauce .
0 three of our five meals , the beef was n't cook completely .
0 the food did n't taste right .
0 needless to say , i am very disappointed .
0 nothing authentic about this place , will definitely not be going back !
0 i was overall unhappy with the service and the food at this establishment .
0 service was extremely grumpy .
0 absolutely no excuse for that !
0 there are far better mexican restaurants in charlotte .
0 frankly i do n't know how this one stays in business .
0 the food it 's self is nothing special or exceptional .
0 if i could give _num_ stars i would .
0 what an awful experience i had with this salon .
0 she did not have a solution for the problem at hand .
0 needless to say some people do n't think outside the box .
0 is this a one person salon that can not resolve an problem like this ?
0 no response but she does call me _num_ mins later .
0 i told her i need a friday after _num_ any week .
0 she offers this friday at _num_ or 2pm .
0 that makes no sense .
0 she is a liar and unorganized .
0 i will tell everyone how horrible she is and how she is a liar !
0 get your story straight if you are gon na lie .
0 i have this place one star , because it ca n't get any lower .
0 very rude and unprofessional , let alone unnecessary .
0 what a waste of time .
0 unfortunately , it failed in less than one year .
0 it smelled and tasted awful .
0 to get home so that i could write it down .
0 i simply do not get a good feeling about practice !
0 looked past that and this week had terrible pain in my foot .

0 their patient referral service is n't any better .
0 do n't go here - you will regret it .
0 horrible front desk service !
0 no letter , nothing !
0 do n't waste your time at this office .
0 this situation takes the icing of the cake though .
0 i can not get over how unprofessional and rude this office staff is !
0 please pay attention to the negative reviews before you experience carmel family physicians .
0 maybe it 's just chinese places that stop serving ?
0 they lost my business for good .
0 i know i should have called beforehand .
0 i felt like this one waitress was very rude .
0 it was kind of shady business practice so i wo n't go back .
0 service : confused but trying to be helpful .
0 the chicken wings use to be one of the highlights of going here .
0 i read today in south charlotte weekly that they recieved a grade of _num_ .
0 customer service is lacking .
0 the waitresses said little to nothing ( which is the usual case ) .
0 really this place just needs to be more hospitable .
0 atmosphere is cluttered and tables are too close together for any privacy .
0 i am a sushi snob , and am extremely particular about my sushi .
0 it tasted like wasabi , but why the hell was it brown ?
0 we also ordered pan fried pork with kimchi .
0 the rolls come in pieces of _num_ , which i find weird .
0 i am typically used to larger rolls with _num_ or _num_ pieces .
0 we have not been back .
0 venue - the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in japan .
0 sushi - the unagi ( eel ) was cooked perfectly .
0 they need better selections in sushi .
0 as for sushi , i would only come here once .
0 also , if you do n't tip enough .
0 arrived , party of _num_ on a wednesday night .
0 the sushi set i ordered was a typical americanized sushi affair .
0 not authentic at all .
0 i was very unimpressed .
0 neither were anything special .
0 the chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce .
0 was not good at all .
0 the sushi was mediocre at best .
0 never know sashimi can be this bad .
0 worst sashimi experience ever .
0 the table was also sticky and gross !
0 i was not impressed and will never go back !
0 none would make eye contact or acknowledge my presence .
0 i 'd suggest to check everything before you leave the store .
0 looks like very other cvs .
0 unfortunately i usually come here for the pharmacy .
0 they are so slow and are not any help .
0 the wait time to check out is absurd .
0 usually only one cashier is working and they are slow .
0 in addition to being slow , the cashiers i have encountered are rude .
0 i sent in a photo order online ( same day prints ) .
0 it took this cvs at least _num_ days to process the order .
0 oh no , same lady still at the register .
0 i understand that everyone has bad days .
0 that does n't excuse poor service and a `` screw you '' attitude .
0 i drove around for _num_ minutes looking for this place .
0 am i missing something ?
0 and the gym was okay but nothing special .
0 do n't move here this place is horrible !
0 there is something always wrong with the apartment .
0 the worst apartment i 've ever lived in !
0 i 've only been here _num_ months and i 'm miserable .
0 if you are thinking of renting here do n't !
0 they have `` lost my security deposit '' !
0 lease has me listed in wrong apt .
0 the biggest thing is they lost the money !
0 run , do n't walk from this place !
0 biggest mistake i ever made !
0 never have i heard of this being done elsewhere .
0 but why did they sign up for this contract in the first place ?
0 of course nothing happened on monday .
0 no one seems to be communication for efficiency .
0 i 've lived in many apartments before and this one is the worst .
0 here is another review on alexander place- the management team is horrible !
0 all they want is your money !
0 medium cup of tomato soup : $ _num_ do n't expect a roll .
0 no , thank you .
0 the sandwich options were limited , and staff completely unhelpful .
0 have given this new spot several chances and it has disappointed each time .
0 service is spotty and knowledge of wine / training of servers has dropped significantly .
0 but , we wanted to try the tuscan beans so stayed .
0 needless to say i will never set foot in this place again .
0 i repeat this was a bottle listed on the menu not from the retail .
0 d & d is expensive .
0 however , the food quality simply does n't warrant the cost .
0 a piece of two layer cake , is over six dollars .
0 my husband and i come to the wine room often because we live nearby .
0 it turns out , she 's not even old enough to drink !
0 the young man behind the bar did n't look of age , either .
0 i ca n't believe it .
0 it pains me to write this review !
0 however , there is no excuse for such poor service .
0 bar was empty sans a handful of people .
0 almost appeared to be an inconvenience for her to wait on us .
0 i 'll be back to d & d but not to the wine room !
0 sat outside for _num_ min with no service .
0 waitress showed up _num_ min later .
0 will not come back until they change entire staff , other than bartender .
0 what a horrible experience .
0 just opened them up an poured .
0 neither of what we wanted when i said sweet .
0 we were not going to buy anything else .
0 he also offered me a free lunch on the house which i turned down .
0 bill came to $ _num_ .
0 wine prices even higher than paris or london .
0 they only cost _num_ in paris and _num_ in the rest of the country .
0 anyway , if i lived here i doubt i 'd hang here much .
0 had we just stayed on the market side it would be fine .
0 she suggested we grab some wine and take it back into the market .
0 i had the shrimp and grits and it was ... not good .
0 the spaghetti and mussels were pretty good though .
0 i grew up going to the south park location .
0 hence why i needed the coffee .
0 it was obvious we were n't up to par with the wine room .
0 there were only three other tables in the restaurant .
0 no excuse for this .
0 so this should n't be happening .
0 i never told them about the cockroach because they did n't deserve to know .
0 overall myself and my friend were deeply disappointed in our visit .
0 they did n't even deserve a one star .
0 this company and leasing managers are racist and treat people like they are nothing .
0 the _num_ bedroom apartment we rented was a fucking dump when we moved in .
0 we gave a written notice to the leasing manager and a doctors letter .
0 no way will they get away with this .
0 i 'm terrified of those things .
0 she said oh , i do n't want to kill it .
0 horrible place to live !
0 i can hear every ... single ... conversation that goes on in the hallway .
0 i now have roaches and my apartment has already been sprayed once .
0 i 'm beyond disgusted .
0 that is n't enough to make us love the place though .
0 dead roach on the bamboo on my steam dumpling basket .
0 perhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup .
0 it was very bland , and did n't taste like anything .
0 tasteless egg in water is definitely not something you want to keep eating .
0 gross , what happened ?
0 this last time there was pure disappointment .
0 each dish tasted like it had the same sauce as a base .
0 it was way too salty !
0 blah ... and i 'm sad that it was n't better .
0 i find the rice in any chinese buffet way much better !
0 when we walked in we were seated promptly in a nice section .
0 my daughter who picked it up had to leave .
0 i ended up eating crackers and peanut butter at home instead .
0 my salmon was dry and flavorless with the filler rice .
0 i do not think i will go there again without a gift certificate .
0 too bad , i hope they change cooks .
0 this is a waste of time and money .
0 but the food was not outstanding for the price or the ambiance .
0 it had no spice or bite at all .
0 the pepper steak was edible , but not delicious or memorable by any means .
0 it felt like a dish that had been reheated in the microwave .
0 i found out that portion size is good , then bad .
0 do not go there , they have no customer service !
0 years ago , this place was my favorite restaurant .
0 the service is incredibly slow .
0 waiter was loud and too casual .
0 sea bass was steamed spinach coated in soy sauce .
0 this place could have gotten a better score but for the service .
0 they sent _num_ to a table of two .
0 wo n't be back .
0 it 's on the pricey side , but you probably know that already .
0 it takes money to keep the engine running .
0 what is really bad is the service .
0 well , that 's not entirely true .
0 but the wait for the food is absolutely ridiculous .
0 another bad experience two times in a row .
0 chang 's on tuesday night and have to say that is was terrible .
0 maybe i am spoiled but in every p.f .
0 here , however , i have received nothing .
0 i will not visit this restaurant anymore and can not recommend it .
0 at 1pm , with lots of open tables , they could n't seat me .
0 looks like they are having staffing problems .
0 so , today , zero stars , but overall two .
0 the service was not so great .
0 the waiter added another dollar to the tip i had already written .
0 he did n't deserve more than _num_ % .
0 we sat there for about _num_ minutes with soup spilled all over the table .
0 the menu changes are n't necessarily better .
0 my changs spare ribs were just northern style ribs with bbq sauce on them .
0 so salty i ate one and threw them out .
0 for almost $ _num_ we had a very disappointing dinner .
0 tonight i wanted to grab a quick brew before a yelp event .
0 worst mother 's day experience ever .
0 so it 's mother 's day and we did not have a reservation .
0 the wait time quote was an hour _num_ minutes .
0 they sat us in an hour _num_ minutes - not bad !
0 i expected to wait _num_ hours so technically they were early !
0 they had no high chairs so we had to wait .
0 _num_ minutes later our appetizers came out but no kids meal !
0 our meal did n't arrive to our table until _num_ 1/2 hours after ordering .
0 i kept bringing the _num_ month old outside to walk around .
0 the _num_ month old is not happy .
0 from now on , i 'll stick to take-out .
0 the whole staff especially our server were so unhappy saturday .
0 the food was so greasy and took _num_ min to come out .
0 she did n't seem to care at all either .
0 $ _num_ average a person for chinese does n't get you anything here now .
0 this was my second time here , and it was a disaster , again .
0 never have i had so much anxiety having a meal .
0 tried again today with my husband , nope .
0 the salad was nasty , iceberg with some dressing that tasted like onions .
0 i mean _num_ bucks is no big deal , but it 's extremely annoying .
0 very disappointing experience recently .
0 very poor experience no one accepts responsibility .
0 when did this place get expensive ?
0 small portions and pricey lunch .
0 had _num_ children with me and our lunch was $ _num_ .
0 my wife and i went to pf changs tonight for dinner .
0 oh my gosh both of our dishes were horrible .
0 my wife got the honey glazed chicken and i got the sichuan beef .
0 the only tasty dish was our appetizer lettuce wrap .
0 even the stupid fortune cookies were stale .
0 caution to anyone having that craving for good upscale chinese food .
0 raspberry sauce is sitting out on my counter as i continue eating cake .
0 called pf changs where the first `` manager '' sent me to another manager .
0 i love chocolate and that cake was $ _num_ ( tax ) .
0 taken _num_ tries to get order right and the server could care less .
0 i could not put another bite in my mouth .
0 it made me sick .
0 i have shopped at harris teeter park road for over _num_ years .
0 i have witnessed same manager return a cake only _num_ slices left .
0 returned with smiles and no hassle .
0 it is _num_ park rd harris teeter .
0 tried to buy about _num_ worth of groceries at self checkout .
0 refused to substitute as i see other customers do all the time !
0 _num_ employees confirmed no more waters in back .
0 still no fair and normal customer service offered to me ?
0 i do n't understand the hype for this place .
0 service was ok and my filet mignon was so overcooked and lacked flavor .
0 will not come back .
0 eh , went here on christmas for dinner .
0 wine was outrageously overpriced .
0 overcooked , tough and tasted like it had gone bad .
0 been there _num_ times .
0 not a big fan .
0 i was very , very disappointed in this place .
0 we ordered the burgers and they were dry & barely edible .
0 our waitress was also terrible .
0 do n't waste your money .
0 this was n't my first choice , but sullivan 's was not available .
0 the choices were pumpkin or chocolate pecan pie .
0 i am disappointed that a high-end steakhouse does not have a pastry chef .
0 it is impossible get from a to b outside or inside the place .
0 we asked ... should we get out own menus ?
0 he then proceeded to chat with some waiter buddies in plain view .
0 i just could n't believe a _num_ oz .
0 so , we ordered the veal and chicken parm .
0 up to ~ $ _num_ ) .
0 honestly i 'm not sure what the big rave is about this place .
0 and for a steakhouse that was some lame steak .
0 desert choices were flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake .
0 thankfully it was n't my tab and i 'd never go back .
0 _num_ different family events and all _num_ were screwed up .
0 it was so burnt as to be charred .
0 it was turned into gray meat and cost almost _num_ dollars .
0 way overpriced and not worth the trip !
0 noisy , noisy bar !
0 if you want a great steakhouse , go to ruth 's chris .
0 it 's a shame but both of the things i had heard were correct .
0 it just was n't that good .
0 the steaks had no flavor and the lobster was overcooked .
0 the filet was also not very flavorful but better than the lobster .
0 i will not be back !
0 we ordered the humongous $ _num_ lobster and we should have known better .
0 lastly , we made our reservations through open table , which was honored .
0 just ca n't see it for the money .
0 not quite sure what the target market is for this place .
0 capital grille two weeks ago , my son , same thing .
0 not impressed with the food .
0 in fact , it is barely even memorable .
0 ok food , not too exceptional .
0 not to return , i am afraid .
0 velvet corn and chicken soup was tasty but needed lots of pepper .
0 ugh ... way overpriced , same taste as the food court at the mall .
0 it would have been nice if they had told me this before i ordered .
0 the dumplings were just okay .
0 waited a long time to try this place .
0 however , the food was borderline bad .
0 the chicken portion was at least half vegetables , which was very disappointing .
0 the chicken itself was mediocre at best .
0 the replacement order was poorly made and rushed .
0 i was highly disappointed .
0 the least she could have done was to put a credit on my account .
0 i immediately notified the staff and was told the manager would be notified .
0 this is the worst experience ever .
0 it is jessica fault !
0 give me a break !
0 this is the last time i visit this establishment .
0 the eggs i ordered scrambled and they were too dry for me .
0 unfortunately , a charlotte main stay has worn out the welcome pad .
0 the meals are over priced and just ok in terms of quality .
0 when my husband spoke to the manager , he could care less about it .
0 so , to anyone reading this , i would look for another breakfast option .
0 i do not get it .
0 why does this place get voted best breakfast ?
0 tried again today and were again sorely disappointed .
0 after going here for years , boy were we disappointed .
0 it 's like no one cared any more .
0 the manager could n't have cared less .
0 no refills on coffee , and the food was nowhere as good as previously .
0 it will be a long time before we consider another visit .
0 not so much here .
0 i 'm not going to finish it .
0 hell , i may not even last _num_ bites .
0 in addition to shitty service is the lack of service to begin with .
0 you ca n't eat pancakes with your hand .
0 speaking of coffee , their coffee is brutal .
0 then i realized they serve royal cup coffee .
0 this is the kind of coffee you serve to people you hate .
0 apparently , the management at oph hates their customers .
0 the joint seems to bring out a giant stack of stupid in people .
0 instead she could of said ok would you like something else instead .
0 she ended up sitting on my lap to eat .
0 it was an okay experience - sure was n't what i expected .
0 i was n't too impressed with my visit here .
0 the potatoes i ordered were extremely salty and had very little flavor .
0 pancakes and bacon horrible .
0 most recently , i went here on a sunday for brunch with my family .
0 the chicken sandwich i ordered was awful .
0 i just sat there for _num_ minutes while my party ate their food .
0 nice courts , but horrible communication about the courts being reserved .
0 the quality of the clothing was pathetic and most of the items were ugly .
0 the layout is terrible !
0 once again , horrible customer service !
0 what a complete waste of time .
0 terrible customer service at the cafe over the weekend .
0 also they had problems with their soda machine .
0 he never spoke to a single black customer .
0 the atmosphere is less friendly .
0 next time we want greek food , we 'll go to the mad greek .
0 a little more pricey but it caught my eye .
0 except maybe on small business saturday .
0 i have spent thousands of dollars at this store .
0 went a second time and did not have a great experience .
0 sat in a different seat and that seat did n't work as well .
0 pedicure turned out good , but manicure not so much .
0 i wo n't be going back .
0 can i rate less than a star ?
0 so we got up and walked out .
0 not fair to the customer at all .
0 i ended up with square shaped nails that were mediocre at best .
0 you can guarantee i will never step foot in this place again .
0 she did not apologize nor did she take me seriously .
0 the sales staff ( if you can call them that ) were complete snobs .
0 later i am still dealing with their screw ups .
0 ordered a very a very large and heavy coat rack .
0 we could not get it together because it did n't line up .
0 wow , were has customer service gone ?
0 walked in and no one never said hello .
0 good thing i was n't a secret shopper .
0 overly expensive attorney who will not deliver any results !
0 do not make the same mistake that i did !
0 i was in there _num_ minutes before anyone spoke with me .
0 an older man that works there stared at me and never spoke .
0 however , they will not get my money .
0 so let me go over this : i have a coupon .
0 i do n't have that coupon .
0 me - _num_ , her - _num_ .
0 _num_ of us that i know were sized wrong .
0 customer service was terrible .
0 after we purchased our suits they would not correct it .
0 highly recommend not buying a suit here .
0 these people do not know what they 're doing .
0 when we walked in , no one greeted us or even looked at us .
0 not helpful at all !
0 the lady almost asked for the double price after doing the job .
0 she had to argue and explain but still end up paying $ _num_ extra .
0 this place is below average when it comes to service & pizza 's .
0 disappointed every time i 've gone ... wo n't be trying it anymore !
0 the service was sooo slow .
0 we ordered two seafood entrees , two beers , and an order of sushi .
0 meeting our friends there for a sunday bite was nice .
0 that 's the only reason i 'm giving this place _num_ stars .
0 on top of that , none of the shrimp had been cleaned .
0 that 's beyond gross and completely unacceptable for a seafood restaurant of that caliber .
0 with all the other choices out there - we probably wo n't be back .
0 overly salted entree as well as very salty side of roasted mushrooms .
0 typical south side snob crap .
0 spicy tuna rolls were not fresh and smelled like fish .
0 california rolls lacked flavor and were quite bland .
0 i can not comment on the main courses as we did not have any .
0 gave the restaurant a second shot - equally disappointed .
0 while tasty , the portions are small .
0 unfortunately , the best part of this restaurant is the valet service .
0 food was bland & ill prepared .
0 once our dinner came , everything went downhill .
0 for a place that seems so classy , the experience surely was not .
0 did n't feel respected as a customer .
0 never in my life have i seen someone charge that amount .
0 they had n't been cleaned properly .
0 this place is a total disappointment .
0 it was basically dried out , overly thin and the flavor was not good .
0 the food was very disappointing .
0 the goat cheese was nowhere to be found .
0 the french toast tapas was mediocre .
0 the egg on my wife 's eggs benedict was over-cooked .
0 returning to the buffet , my wife said the shrimp was very salty .
0 ( i do n't eat shrimp . )
0 the desserts were absolutely pathetic .
0 to say that the dessert selection was uninspired is a severe understatement .
0 they should have been included in the price of the brunch .
0 we were not treated as we expected in such an establishment .
0 the food was not very good to my husband and i .
0 maybe we had a bad taste in our mouth already .
0 i went in to ship a package that i needed to return to amazon .
0 i left with my package and i wo n't be back .
0 what a terrible customer service !
0 unbelievably poor customer service .
0 next stop , the better business bureau .
0 the weights are limited and they do n't have a lot of machines .
0 _num_ weeks later i am still waiting on my other shirts .
0 this is completely unacceptable .
0 they refuse to do anything about it .
0 i was told that the equipment failure caused the delay .
0 i took them back and the cleaners cleaned them for free .
0 i spent an average of $ _num_ per month on cleaning .
0 he offered no solution for the shirt that his business ruined .
0 unfortunately the order was sent to flower hut .
0 i , like most people , do not answer `` unknown '' phone numbers .
0 the company was very unprofessional and rude .
0 i 'm completely disappointed , i ordered my mother-in-law flowers for her birthday .
0 it was a disaster , a horrible experience .
0 long story short , what was advertised online looked nothing like what we received .

0 recently had my son 's 9th birthday party here .
0 just do n't expect much for a child 's party .

0 things sure went downhill after that !
0 and that is just annoying .
0 the bathrooms are still disgusting .
0 the interior was updated and looks a little cleaner but it 's nothing special .
0 the drinks are so weak it 's appalling .
0 it was n't overly crowded , but it was n't dead either .
0 i had to scream to someone a foot away from me to be heard .
0 what made it especially awkward - no one was breaking it down .
0 do n't try to pretend you 're something else .
0 plus side , our waitress ( kim ) was pretty awesome .
0 it was empty in there but service was still a little slow .
0 after a lengthy wait our food came out and mine was all wrong .
0 the gave me fried tenders and fries oops !
0 i said no fries and naked tenders means grilled .
0 so no i wo n't be going back .
0 i quickly changed my order to buffalo wings .
0 the sauce was mediocre and one wing ( boneless ) was actually just breading .

0 it was very rude .
0 the kitchen was poorly managed and the staff was struggling to handle the demand .
0 they had no idea how long it would take .
0 the food was bland .
0 it was over cooked & the sauce was more soy like than smooth .
0 i have found a restaurant that i hate and is this one .
0 hate the atmosphere , so dark during the day .
0 the food is terrible .
0 thought i would give it another shot after a previous bad experience .
0 if you are only familiar with mall chinese maybe you would like this place .
0 ca n't say the same for the quality of the food .
0 either they do n't carry it or i could n't find it .
0 its downright awful and has been for awhile .
0 so bad i have walked out and i have seen others do the same .
0 however , the employees in the meat department are very rude .
0 however , i decided not to purchase it from this store .

0 and on my third trip i made $ _num_ .
0 i immediately noticed that the store is dark and dated .
0 it was an awful experience .
0 i wasted my gas and my time .
0 and i 've never had to wait longer than _num_ minutes .

0 the customer next to me asked three more times very nicely for the water .
0 very poor service and i was completely unimpressed .
0 `` kelly '' is rude .
0 needless to say i will not be going back .
0 total waste of money !
0 this place is empty .
0 apparently they do n't like business .
0 no way will i be back any time soon .
0 the line was endless and crowded .
0 my husband orders the calamari and i ordered the lobster bisque .
0 i was n't all that impressed with it .
0 it was so nasty , we did n't finish our salads .
0 my husband was very dissapointed in the steak and regretted eating it .
0 i ordered crme brulee and my husband had their almond basket with ice cream .
0 my husband had a little better luck with his than i did .
0 we get our bill and come to find out it 's $ _num_ .
0 we went here for restaurant week and it was yuck , just yuck .
0 i do n't know why i keep going back to this place .
0 when we first got in , there was nobody at the hostess station .
0 she said no , we got our check , and left .
0 my lasagna was a $ _num_ meal at best .
0 my wife said her 's was priced decently but had no flavor .
0 i was greeted by a friendly hostess and seated at a comfy booth .
0 the second bite was stringy steak .
0 overall it was n't a bad sandwich at all .
0 oven was n't working so no pizzas available .
0 over priced for average , below average food .
0 the answer is try harder to find a source because they are out there .
0 the cauliflower was good but there spinach all i tasted was vinegar .
0 the fruit was n't ripe and over all the experience was just bad .
0 i am sure i will not be returning .

0 however , no matter what you will always find a bad store .
0 i ordered a combo they made a mistake and gave me the wrong sandwich .
0 i was on break i did not have time to go back that day .

0 bad customer service they just do not care at this location .
0 i do n't have to eat here , have n't been back since .
0 the doctor said it was nothing .
0 all the doctor could say was `` hmmm , that 's really weird '' .
0 i took my dog in got his medication , it cleared up immediately .
0 i agreed and scheduled the surgery for wednesday .
0 not a _num_ % credit .

0 the staff is unorganized and it is incredibly difficult to reach a doctor .
0 i would not recommend anyone to take their pet to this facility .
0 i 'm only giving _num_ stars because the optometrist was fine .
0 last time i ordered contacts , the wrong prescription was sent home with me .
0 ok , but that is n't what i wanted to do .
0 unfortunately that is where the good news stops !
0 and they looked at me like i had _num_ heads .
0 she did not return my call , so i called again .
0 a rip off of you ask me .

0 no one came to check the unit for mold .
0 they told me they wont give me the corporate number .
0 they ca n't seem to tell me anything .
0 i just want to be done with these apartments .
0 i shrugged it off and called maintenance .
0 sure they took a few days and gave me light bulbs .
0 they did n't even fix it .
0 to this day it continues to peel off and it is disgusting .
0 the next issue is that these walls are paper thin .
0 i 'm sorry , what ?
0 do n't sign a lease with these jerks .
0 ultimately you will get screwed over .
0 literally the worst apartment complex .
0 _num_ weeks later and nothing has been done .
0 we 've requested work orders _num_ weeks ago and still nothing has been done .
0 the huge problem is the teppanyaki ... just awful .
0 i ate there over the christmas holidays .
0 - the chicken was so salty it was inedible .
0 only a _num_ year old could be comfortable eating here .
0 - i did n't say anything because my relatives have friends who work there .
0 if not for this , i 'd have talked to the manager .
0 the food was awful and the presentation was worse .
0 it 's really gone downhill .
0 the quality of all there food simply was not there .
0 the japanese food here is nasty compare to other places in charlotte .
0 my to go meal ended up being $ _num_ bucks after taxes and tip .
0 the meat were tasteless and dry and so were the veggies !

0 average japanese steakhouse experience .
0 staff was very friendly ( hostess , waitress and chef ) .
0 i wo n't be back .
0 well it 's not the place it use to be .
0 that stuff is nasty .
0 dude get over it and go make your ring of fire .
0 i had the fillet , scallops and shrimp .
0 the restaurant is run down , and not cleaned thoroughly .
0 that is not cool .
0 the place was shabby and the floor was filthy .
0 he could n't save the day , though .
0 i would not return , and i can not recommend .
0 i believe he is a sushi chef and certainly lacks management skills .
0 the service was n't bad , and the presentation was typical .
0 first off , i sat in the sushi bar area .
0 i have not eaten in the dinner area yet .
0 i just know better sushi places .
0 they had a crappy and small sake selection and their cheapest bottle was _num_ .
0 also i had to get a new soy sauce bowl .
0 i was _num_ minutes late , no need to yell .
0 probably will only go back for take out .
0 but how does a japanese hibachi not know what an unagi roll is ?
0 so not worth it .
0 staff were not as attentive as other restaurants .
0 very pricey and they automatically add _num_ % gratuity with your bill .
0 we will never go back here sadly .
0 if you want an authentic hibachi experience , this is not the place .
0 good for kids , bad for people who appreciate good japanese food .
0 the restaurant was not busy so we should not have been so rushed .
0 it was very unprofessional .
0 the entire staff was hispanic , not japanese .
0 i just expected a nicer meal for that kind of money .
0 i felt extremely uncomfortable there , and the buffet was not worth its price .
0 the naan bread was like a rubber sheet .
0 they never bothered to refill the bread basket .
0 the chicken curry was passable .
0 chicken tikka masala was below average .
0 the only thing they bothered to refill was water .
0 were somewhat disappointed ( probably due to higher expectations ) .
0 the overall experience seemed somewhat disappointing .
0 but starting 2-3 years ago the food went downhill .
0 bummer to need to post a negative review of a previous favorite .
0 probably one of the worst indian food i have ever had in usa .
0 went there for sunday buffet and the food was terrible .
0 serving is bad and avoid this restaurant .
0 one of the worst indian meals we have had in a long time .
0 - lamb kabobs - undercooked and falling apart .
0 a big f for this .
0 tasted bland for what is supposed to be a very flavorful dish .
0 one can understand , this is charlotte and thus not a indian food destination .
0 but the miss on simple kabobs clearly show a careless staff .
0 in my opinion , a waste of money .
0 service was average to bad .
0 food quality left a lot to be improved .
0 meat was not cooked properly and was very chewy .
0 overall i do n't recommend it and wo n't be going back at all .
0 our waiter was friendly , he came to refill our waters twice .
0 i was a bit disappointed in the selection .
0 i am a vegetarian , so i was already limited in my choices .
0 their food was extremely heavy and could only eat one full plate .
0 food has never made me feel that way .
0 in my opinion , this is an americanized indian restaurant .
0 by the time i had some , it was cold , chewy and blah .
0 no spices or raisin and naan .
0 worst indian food i have ever eat in us .
0 the spread is average , quality of food and service unimpressive .
0 saw a huge roach on the wall .
0 no apologies or comment as we were paying the bill .
0 wish i could give it less .
0 ridiculous is how to best describe the buffets .
0 cold , bland and that 's even if you get to see some food .
0 only _num_ other _num_ person tables there .
0 i only wish i had taken a picture of the buffet to prove it .
0 do n't say i did n't tell you so .
0 anyway i 'm sure they will be closed soon .
0 i just came from lunch with coworkers here .
0 ordered the shrimp and mixed vegetables , was served the shrimp and broccoli .
0 probably all the same sauce anyway .
0 shrimp and broccoli both tasted like freezer .
0 and now i 'm craving fortune cookie .
0 i 'm so sad right now .
0 well everything was kinda disappointing .
0 no bueno , not for me .
0 next time ill pass .
0 from there , sadly , it began to go downhill .
0 also he asked me if i wanted a menu ... ... strange .
0 cold , hard and greasy .
0 panda 's den in north charlotte puts this place to shame .
0 the hostess told me that there were not three ladies sitting together .
0 i know they just walked in ahead of me .
0 first impression : the place is old and in need of some updates .
0 two people in our party ordered chicken broccoli with fried rice and egg rolls .
0 one person got white rice instead of fried rice as ordered .
0 the waitress did offer to get the fried rice .
0 it tasted very much like the brown sauce was burnt .
0 the egg rolls were overcooked and almost burnt .
0 i had eaten here before and it was much better in the past .
0 so they great wall is not so great .
0 maybe just have some soup for lunch .
0 sad to say i wo n't take friends here again .
0 she was waited on before us and no apology was given .
0 never have experienced anything like this before !
0 will not be going back to give them any of my money !
0 what great wall of china south serves is cheap , frozen egg rolls .
0 i wo n't be back .
0 so we ate our apps and still no one .
0 had to wait forever for our check .
0 the crab rangoons were simply not crab rangoons .
0 there was no cream cheese flavor whatsoever .
0 i am not sure what they were , but not what i was expecting .
0 no idea why this place was full .
0 many great chinese restaurants around , this is not one .
0 this place is bad !
0 the service is bad , the food is bad and the prices are high !
0 the only thing i enjoyed was the wonton soup !
0 such a waste of money and time.
0 worst chinese food ever !
0 the location , atmosphere , and service were all good so no complaints there .
0 the food however was not .
0 when finally the entree arrived it was relatively without taste .
0 my husband and i went this past saturday for dinner .
0 because i usually judge a restaurant for being authentic if their own people go .
0 the wait staff leaves a lot to be desired , the hosts are great .
0 okay the favorite shrimp was disgusting .
0 the sauce tasted old and i could n't even stomach to eat it .
0 have n't been there in about _num_ years and man has it changed .
0 the hot and sour soup is exactly that .
0 the place was n't too crowded for a lunch hour so that was nice .
0 i wo n't get another certificate for this restaurant .
0 mainly because the service was horrible .
0 which was n't deserved at all .
0 so yes i gave it a two star rating because of service .
0 and that 's not what we got .
0 no wonder they are on groupon !
0 nothing stood out about them whatsoever .
0 i 'm only writing this to save someone else from wasting money .
0 it was very soupy and did not have any noodles ?
0 the onion pancake was incredibly dry .
0 poor service and okay food .
0 nothing special to write about .
0 if they did n't have half price groupons , i would never eat here .
0 went back yesterday after passing over for several years .
0 used to be one of my favorite places .
0 will admit beverage glasses were kept full , but nor a single pleasant gesture .
0 again not a real problem just one part of the entire experience .
0 how can you mess up wonton soup and vegetable spring rolls .
0 the sesame chicken was terrible .
0 i had a groupon so i check this place out .
0 the rice was burnt and the beef and broccoli was very salty .
0 the next time i went was for a lunch on saturday .
0 and honestly there is nothing special here .
0 the service was lacking , the check was dropped off right after the food .
0 the place did seem busy , which i think is because of the groupon .
0 the food is seriously lacking .
0 my hot and sour soup was terrible in flavor .
0 the shrimp in my dish were the really small cheap shrimp .
0 it is essentially just fast food in a sit down restaurant .
0 there was not one thing that i would even recommend to anyone .
0 it was all so blah .
0 i had not seen it before but though it looked very quiet .
0 so i only ordered lunch .
0 first no spoon or soy sauce .
0 then the egg roll was soggy .
0 they did not even cook it fresh .
0 it was so bad .
0 the egg drop soup had no flavor either .
0 the manager said i can take _num_ % off of your bill !
0 thanks but no thanks !
0 i have not been back .
0 went to thai house on a thursday around 8pm .
0 i did n't see any shrimp , not even mini shrimp .
0 the pad thai was n't bad ... not great , but not bad .
0 i 'm not sure if i 'll go back to thai house .
0 to use up a groupon , we had dinner there last night .
0 my roast duck was a little misleading considering it was more fried than roasted .
0 the same or better is available elsewhere .
0 red curry was very thin , which should not be the case .
0 it should be thicker than what i ate .
0 beef pieces were small .
0 overall the portion to price ratio is poor .
0 duck curry was okay .
0 i would not recommend this item if same is prepared again .
0 fried shrimps were below average .
0 any household can prepare those at home without much efforts .
0 as an exception to other thai restaurants , attendant lady was courteous .
0 i would not recommend to visit second time .
0 i do n't pay such a high price for ambiance .
0 i 'm not a fan really .
0 so i decided to try thai house again as my craving was strong .
0 which that was the least of my worries but it was n't any good .
0 it 's supposed to have chicken , clear noodles , and mixed vegetables .
0 essentially for me , it 's like fast food quality .
0 _num_ for beef basil ?
0 it was a big disappointment !
0 the service here is horrible !
0 we never got asked if we needed anything else and received no water refill .
0 it was dried and crusty like its been sitting out for too long .
0 big disappointment on that dish .
0 i ate it just because i was hungry .
0 the decor in the restaurant was nice though .
0 perhaps the main chef was not working on the weekday night i was there .
0 not likely to try again though .
0 and my husbands roasted chicken was frozen in the inside but cooked through ?
0 i am _num_ months pregnant and ordered green curry for take out from here .
0 secondly , it was not that great .
0 it was mediocre curry at best .
0 so , goodbye $ _num_ curry .
0 i did n't save the leftovers .
0 i always keep my university thai house leftovers for a second meal .
0 my chicken pad thai tasted too sweet .
0 the noodles were overcooked and mushy .
0 the spring roll is slightly burnt and the chicken rubbery .
0 disappointing because we were looking for a good thai place in charlotte .
0 very little chicken in both the soup and the drunken noodle .
0 i 'm sad because this was my favorite thai restaurant .
0 i had a really negative experience ordering takeout from here .
0 the pad thai itself was really disappointing .
0 the noodles were so over-cooked that they were falling apart into tiny pieces .
0 i ate about a third of it and threw the rest away .
0 waited _num_ minutes for someone to take our order .
0 oh , and we did ask to order many times , but just ignored .
0 below average and i will not return .
0 like many successful restaurants this one too - tanks .
0 when all else fails this place was so reliable .
0 not anymore i guess .
0 i gave it a try and i was really disappointed .
0 it tasted exactly like watered down ketchup .
0 however , we had the papaya salad as an appetizer and that was great .
0 went tonight and ordered pad thai .
0 they have switched sauces , the usual peanut sauce was missing .
0 in its place was a watered down ketchup sauce .
0 we also ended up with _num_ waitresses .
0 not impressed , left hungry .
0 she was slow , rude , and incompetent .
0 i will not be back to this clinic again .
0 this is by far the worst .
0 never ... have my prescriptions ever been ready on time .
0 when i called in to let them know , they did n't even care .
0 i 'm actually sorry i ever even ate there .
0 no wonder this place was empty on at _num_ in the evening .
0 needless to say , there are plenty if better options around .
0 the first time i got to the car and checked - it was wrong .
0 there was dead silence , i asked again and she hung up on me !
0 i had my reservations about stopping at this location tonight .
0 i will not be back !
0 you wo n't get what you order anyway , so go anywhere else .
0 because that was the rude person taking my order .
0 then i was confused .
0 this is the only chinese restaurant i like in charlotte .
0 u can find all the yummy food on the authentic menu .
0 my favorite is the beef noodle and the pig feet .
0 the owner is different now and the new menu sucks !
0 just like other yucky american chinese restaurant now !
0 tried a different chinese restaurant in the area and wish i did not .
0 got shrimp with mixed vegetables .
0 also got the teriyaki beef which was like shoe leather ( very tough ) .
0 will not be going back .
0 hot and sour soup was bland .
0 crispy noodles were stale .
0 my girlfriend is a vegetarian so one can imagine this ruined her dinner .
0 certainly will not return to quick wok .
0 i was very disappointed in the food here .
0 it sucks that this is the closest chinese restaurant in our area .
0 food is only fair - burger was pretty flavorless and dry .
0 the food is actually fairly mediocre .
0 i went here for a nostalgic feeling , but the food was shabby .
0 i will never use lowe 's for installation ever again .
0 now , a week later , i have lost all patience .
0 waited _num_ mins at the paint counter with no acknowledgement of my presence .
0 john at the paint counter could use some customer service training .
0 i am going to give up on lowes .
0 it was an overall bad experience here .
0 the service was slow and the food was tasteless .
0 i would probably not return here .
0 the wait was over _num_ minutes and the waiter was next to the worst .
0 if i wanted to i could buy this place .
0 today however i think was not a great experience .
0 the food was ok , but the service was lacking .
0 just spent $ _num_ for two people at lunch .
0 cost was $ _num_ .
0 looked nothing like the picture .
0 wo n't be doing lunch here again .
0 our entrees arrived about _num_ minutes after the salad .
0 she had smoked wings with ranch dressing , they arrived with barbecue sauce .
0 it was over cooked and tasteless .
0 this time was n't so great .
0 daughter ordered classic burger with fries and our appetizer was the new fried pickles .
0 the pickles came out fast and were very hot .
0 finally the entrees come and low and behold my pasta is the regular way .
0 slowest server i have ever had .
0 i am so disappointed .
0 poor service , especially during slow times .
0 my stomach had turned at this point so i said `` no . ''
0 all the waitresses know me and stop by and talk .
0 avoid this place if you value your health !
0 the fries were horrible .
0 i stood there as she looked at a phone after helping another guest .
0 they were full except one table that the guests behind me quickly claimed .
0 she offered no further help and i offered no further business .
0 would 've been so simple to just acknowledge me and offer some service .
0 i 'm not even sure where to start .
0 park _num_ cafe is under new management .
0 our order required _num_ ... so no that 's not ok .
0 well scratch the quick now .
0 as usual it was mediocre at best .
0 to be honest i was offended and just shook my head .
0 you used to be ok but now you just do n't care anymore .
0 you no longer deserve my business .
0 this was an awful experience .
0 it was cold had a horrible flavor a lot of fat on the chicken .
0 and to top it off there was n't even an egg roll .
0 bad food , horrible service .
0 we waited a long time for our courses and forever for our check .
0 we would n't have tipped that much based on the above comments .
0 very busy place for rather mediocre food .
0 the salad dressing was okay , but missing something .
0 i ordered the teriyaki steak and it had zero teriyaki flavor .
0 the meat itself did not taste good .
0 it was n't spoiled tasting , more like a really cheap cut of meat .
0 i only ate about three bites .
0 it was very watery and bland : ( .
0 major disappointment as that stuff is the highlight of a hibachi visit !
0 the positives are that the staff were friendly and worked quickly .
0 i can not imagine complaints about portion size !
0 moderately busy , but seated right away .
0 wo n't be returning .
0 given this place too many opportunities and they constantly fail .
0 you can tell they use cheap steak and lobster .
0 the sauces are not good and they are constantly rushing you .
0 i literally had my soup and salad delivered within _num_ seconds of each other .
0 then the chef comes out to rush us .
0 the chef was entertaining but the food was n't very good .
0 large portions of noodles and vegetables .
0 i guess they want big portions to make up for poor quality .
0 that is just wrong .
0 it 's not very good .
0 did i mention the hostesses were rude ?
0 too expensive for what you get .
0 a lot of veggies very little steak or chicken .
0 i felt like i had wasted my hard earned money .

0 i would n't recommend this restaurant .
0 this is the worst thai food i have ever had .
0 they have new and used books , all separated into their various sections .
0 the portions are pretty small , and sauces are bland .
0 other than that , i would not recommend .

0 sometimes you luck out with incredible stuff and other times , you miss out .
0 i 've never lucked out here .
0 it 's so crammed and so messy .
0 service was not in any rush .
0 so rude and painfully slow .
0 at the speaker i waited _num_ full minutes & said `` hello ? ''
0 as politely as i could .
0 they said that the meat was kind of tough and dry .
0 if you asked me if i 'd return , i 'd probably say no .
0 they have me a baked potato .
0 i also ordered _num_ breads with it and only received one .
0 she ended up paying $ _num_ .
0 worst customer experience of my life .
0 the amount of time to get service was completely unacceptable .
0 my husband was afraid to eat it in the fear of getting sick .
0 i used to really like outback in nj but i 'm in nc now .

0 i denied the managers offer to send it back .
0 sad too i used to love outback .
0 it 's a real shame .
0 the shrimp was just gross .
0 i order sirloin and grilled prawns .
0 the guy waiter was not much nicer .

0 however , i was n't overly impressed with the service .
0 this is the 2nd time visiting and 2nd time being disappointed .
0 the first time i went with a group of _num_ other friends .
0 the service was less than okay and food was mediocre , nothing really memorable .
0 went with a group of about _num_ - _num_ people on a thursday night .
0 the service was slow .
0 i think it was the worst mexican food i 've ever eaten .
0 even taco bell 's tacos were better tasting than this one .
0 the rice was dry and the salsa seemed to come right of the can .
0 i would not recommend uptown retreat .
0 i do n't like being lied to .
0 the real problem was the hair cut .
0 it was a disaster .
0 so my hair is lighter on the top and darker on the bottom .
0 my largest complaint is the cut it is awful !
0 he literally spent _num_ minutes cutting my hair if that .
0 i actually found this salon on yelp and am terribly disappointed .
0 i have never spent so much money to look this bad .
0 i can not recommend anyone doing business at uptown retreat salon .
0 i made a huge mistake .
0 but it makes me wan na go try caribou coffee .
0 not something i 'd regularly do .
0 the caribou associates know how to treat customers .
0 she offered no apology or solution .
0 this is the worst customer service i 've ever had at a starbucks .
0 wow , this thing is horrible .
0 they 're tasty and pretty cheap .
0 you 're better off buying a frozen pizza and cooking it your self .
0 another thing they need to drop are those chopped salads .
0 bottom line : _num_ for _num_ bucks !
0 still not worth it !
0 this version of dick 's does n't get me excited .
0 well there must have been a `` bank error `` they said .
0 i hate bank of america more than anything else in the world .
0 i made zero errors .
0 there was nothing left they could check .
0 i do n't get it .
0 i wish i had done the same .
0 but : concessions are a complete rip-off .
0 i usually know this , but jay talked me into it .

0 i could n't even eat them .
0 the items inside the taco were n't that great either .
0 there was lettuce and guac on the side .
0 the beans were beans , nothing special .

0 the enchiladas were poorly made and for the most part tasteless .
0 we 're done with this poor excuse for a mexican restaurant .
0 being from louisiana , i 'm a huge smoothie king fan .
0 their general smoothie recipe is now _num_ % ice and _num_ % fruit juice .

0 will not go back .
0 do not waste your money !
0 it was just terrible .

0 my air conditioning broke down a total of four times my stay here .
0 worst place to live !
0 they also run out of sweet tea a lot .
0 ( the combo i usually get is _num_ cents less here . )
0 i was thrilled to go and get my oh so favorite breakfast bowl .
0 i really tried to like this place .

0 i know chains tend to be more expensive but this price difference was unreal .
0 do n't waste your time coming here .
0 he never gave me the full total .

0 i advise everyone to stay away from this scam company .
0 they took to long ... bad customer service .
0 they charge alot to have such bad customer service .
0 never go back there again .
0 i did n't like there attitude an customer service .
0 they are there for the money not to reply cater to the customer .

0 no one that works there can do anything about it .
0 how can i describe my experience here ?
0 their chips and salsa is bad .
0 the shrimp tasted like ... nothing .
0 even the cocktail sauce was bad .
0 do i deserve this ?
0 i mean ... shrimp from chilis ?
0 for the price , the food was awful .
0 the managers do n't care the server do n't care .
0 there were dirty plates and cups everywhere .
0 suggest going elsewhere unless you have plenty of time to waste .
0 i really did n't care for the breakfast steak biscuits .
0 the meat patty was coated and then deep fried .
0 it was impossible to tell what type of meat it was .
0 it was like oil on oil .
0 the biscuit itself was ok .
0 but i would not go there for breakfast .
0 i 'm not entirely sure what the fuss about bojangles is .
0 quite frankly , i was a bit sad .
0 it was literally a piece of sadly breaded chicken on a sad biscuit .
0 1st it reeks of cigarettes .
0 the food selection is basically wings , burgers and pizza .
0 i 'll keep this one short - do not go here !
0 to me , that basically means that he has no idea what is wrong .
0 i 'm glad i did n't fill the prescription .
0 same practice same reason double the amount .
0 i do n't get it .
0 since then , the service level has always been horrible in this store .
0 food lion missed the boat big time with this decision .
0 i want to know what fool made this decision .
0 i would n't be surprised to see it close .
0 but this restaurant was not clean .
0 the floors had trash all over them .
0 there was dust around the windows and possible old ketchup .
0 i wo n't come back to this location .

0 there 's a $ _num_ ( ? )
0 deposit on the room that should be refunded in about a week .
0 but it 's not old , either .
0 terribly , terribly thin .
0 do not stay here .
0 the service manager is not an individual i feel that i can trust !
0 are you kidding me ?
0 worst part is my vehicle afterward still had a problem !
0 you do not pay hundreds of dollars for less than perfect service .
0 dealing with the service advisor at this dealership is useless .
0 also , think about buying the warranty on used cars .
0 avoid this place at all costs .
0 by all that is holy , do not stay here .
0 good thing my husband was there , because that was rough .
0 kind of a dingy version of the walgreen 's chain of drug stores .
0 finally , being open 24/7 is a plus at least .
0 i do n't know why i come here .
0 there is nothing to set this place apart from , ugh , walmart .
0 the worst walgreens in the history of walgreens .
0 very slow service with employees who seem to hate their jobs .
0 this walgreens is dreadful to go to .
0 _num_ hour later i came back and waited _num_ min again .
0 i switched drug stores immediately after this experience .
0 they move super slow and were n't helpful at all .
0 the old location would usually be moderately busy .
0 but not like it is now .
0 every time i visit this starbucks , it is completely slammed .
0 i can never find a seat and no one ever leaves .
0 they are usually friendly though .
0 i just dont know what it is .
0 if it was n't for that i would give another star .
0 i would not go back because i did n't feel welcomed at all .
0 my boyfriend and i booked a room on the executive floor for new years .
0 recently renovated but my room was not completed and ac did not function properly .

0 i am extremely disappointed with the way things went at our event !
0 ok , i just ate a science project .

0 the restaurant was completely empty .
0 after almost _num_ minutes , the food arrived .
0 i sent back the flatbread .
0 she was more than gracious and apologetic .
0 we paid and left , completely unsatisfied with the meal .

0 in summary , i would expect so much more from a hilton property .
0 this level of noise makes sleep difficult .
0 this is obviously not a child friendly establishment and we were not welcome there .
0 as for the food , it was just okay .
0 the bagels were chewy and my son could hardly tear his with his teeth .
0 never insult someone 's children .

0 very short and not paying attention to me .
0 i am appalled by the lack of customer service and rude interaction i received .
0 called trying to get info to put together some arrangements .
0 only then are you informed how long the wait will be .
0 obviously this is insane .
0 not much else to say .
0 they also keep soap in a locked display .
0 this is a sketchy location and i do n't feel safe here .
0 especially how long you have to wait in this questionable environment .
0 this makes no sense .
0 wo n't even let you float on your back .
0 there are better and worse y 's for sure .
0 the only thing i ever have to wait on are the free weights .
0 its close , so this is where i go .
0 my family of _num_ is staying here while our house is being worked on .

0 surly staff that was never at the desk .
0 thank goodness i was staying on the first floor with my disabled mother .
0 run away from this property as quickly as possible !
0 made a reservation in june for july .
0 the clerk made and error and made the reservations for june .
0 we went to a wedding only to find the hotel had no room .
0 they did nothing for us , not even an apology .
0 this property has gotten very tired .
0 the place was not even that busy .
0 but the service was bad .
0 bad service gets the same .
0 at the same time , this chain is past its prime .
0 sorry , but this site may disappoint .
0 this place is horrible and has crappy service .
0 they might have to teach their cooks how to cook a steak .
0 not a good sign if you ca n't cook steaks at the right temperature .
0 yep , that loud .
0 this was quite honestly my worst experience ever at a tgi fridays .
0 this time , it went bad .
0 the chicken was soggy , and tasteless .
0 it was a disaster on date night , and very disappointing .
0 i did n't think it was going to be as bad as i experienced .
0 five people could n't see an opened table clearly behind them ?
0 i feel that i probably wo n't be going back to this location again .
0 the only reason i went here was for a book club meeting .
0 i 've been here several times and the food is very sub-par .
0 did n't much like the steak , and the fries were terrible .
0 the service was slow .
0 then i ate there and was reminded .
0 they were suppose to be baby backs but they were dry .
0 eating there made me realize why i never actually go eat there .

0 he then brought the checks and did n't add the cakes in .
0 i did n't put it in .
0 it tasted and smelled like fish .
0 it looked like it was under cooked .
0 i ordered the chicken sandwich which tasted much better .
0 the bun came out soggy and the sandwich did not hold very well together .
0 it was not good .
0 he was unapologetic , rude and a condescending .
0 zero stars for me .
0 they literally messed up on every single person at the tables order .
0 the visit i made on my birthday jan _num_ , was the absolute worst .
0 this after they brought her the absolute wrong order .
0 then it was loud , due to people , and the bartenders .
0 it took _num_ minutes to get drinks !

0 if you 're white , do n't bother .
0 service is extremely slow .
0 endless apps were over _num_ mins apart from the kitchen .

0 we was disappointed of the food and service .
0 bad service & terrible food , do n't recommend .

0 also my girlfriend got very sick after eating here .
0 also notice that the chicken she had ate was undercooked .
0 customer service has been awful and i would not return .
0 she barely came to the table to check on us .
0 she never once refilled our waters .
0 it was a crowded mess .
0 he said , `` thanks for the feedback , '' then he left .
0 the food itself was eh .
0 we ordered two caesar salads , and she brought two house salads .
0 place was n't busy at all .
0 if you are looking for a quick lunch do n't go here .

0 waitress delivered our water and drinks then nothing further for about ten minutes .
0 not very customer service oriented .
0 i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .
0 i highly doubt we will be returning to this restaurant .
0 if i could give this particular applebee 's _num_ stars i would .

0 no biggie because it happens from time to time .
0 she was totally inept .
0 she could n't even get our drink order right .
0 i pointed out the mistake and she apologized and took it back .
0 it must have been _num_ - _num_ minutes before it came .
0 she never even gave us silverware or napkins .
0 we managed to flag down another waitress and asked for silverware and napkins .
0 she went to go get them and never returned .
0 we finished the meal , paid , and left without tipping .
0 no one goes to applebees because they want outstanding food .
0 walked into the smallest waiting area i 've ever seen in a sit-down establishment .
0 _num_ couples ahead of me and my wife ... wait time is 10-15 minutes .
0 _num_ minutes go by and none of the couples before us have been seated .
0 needless to say , we walked out .
0 this place has permanently lost my patronage .
0 first off the management here sucks ass !
0 the server did all that she could but damn !
0 worst service i have ever had .
0 when we said something there was one excuse after another !
0 it 's soup and a wedge salad .
0 no bacon and barely any toppings .
0 i knew my one experience wednesday night was too good to be true .
0 we still stayed because i insisted on applebee 's .
0 do n't waste your time .
0 some overpriced crackers , nuts , or pretzels .
0 i 'm not coming back until she 's either quit or fired !

0 it was a really bad experience .
0 i am not sure how appropriate is to talk to a customer like this .
0 terrible wait times at night .
0 staff appears confused regularly .

0 if you stand near the soda fountain area it will smell like sewage .
0 i had to get up and find my waitress myself .
0 on top of that the food was very salty and greasy .
0 i had _num_ pancakes and they were hard and the syrup was cold .

0 the orange juice did n't taste like real juice .
0 the food was old and somewhat cold .

0 worst customer service ever !
0 the food was flavorless and the chicken was n't cooked all the way .

0 do n't do it because they give you the worst rooms .
0 i 'm allergic to smoke .
0 never going back to a sleep inn again .
0 so we decide to go last evening and man were we disappointed .
0 the most disappointing aspect of our visit was the smoked beef brisket .
0 there was so much fat , and it was fairly tough .
0 having read the reviews , i knew to stay away from the brisket .
0 i went with a `` lunch '' sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast .
0 it was dry and not much more than warm .
0 no , i do n't think so .
0 and it was n't even tender !
0 am i asking for too much ?
0 food was not good .
0 service was not good .
0 do n't waste a meal here .
0 he started off by saying `` just _num_ '' .
0 as though _num_ people was not enough .
0 their screen setup could be awesome , except they are n't hd .
0 do n't waste your time !
0 the local coworkers were n't fans of it either .
0 _num_ people ordered wine , and the first _num_ got it in wine glasses .
0 i didnt taste any alcohol .
0 i ordered the _num_ item platter , as i wanted a taste of everything .
0 the sausage was disgusting , and not spicy at all .
0 lastly , their bathroom reeks of urine .
0 let me say , this place is not somewhere to eat .
0 it 's a drinking place .
0 this was a bad experience from the start .
0 the salad was good , the ribs were as tough as leather .
0 the service was horrible .
0 then _num_ out of _num_ of us had incorrect orders .
0 all of our baked potatoes were hard and cold .
0 it was a mess .
0 needless to say i got no rest .
0 the sheets also had holes in them .
0 least professional staff i have ever seen .
0 on morning one of my visit i accidentally broke the waffle batter machine .
0 apparently maintenance took lunch and never came back .
0 calling corporate offices to complain about this place ... its beyond unacceptable .
0 soooo , needless to say , no waffles for me .
0 this is was far from a hot breakfast if you ask me .
0 the common areas ( lobby , breakfast area , hallway ) were nice .
0 once i got to the room , i was disappointed .
0 there was a smell as soon as i walked in the room .
0 the toilet stopped up and i called the front desk .
0 if my company had n't prepaid for the stay , i would have left .
0 the front desk staff were very courteous and the coffee and breakfast was acceptable .
0 it was n't the best but it was n't the worst .
0 only deserving of _num_ stars .
0 everything about this place screams a budget hotel , except for the price .
0 otherwise , do n't be fooled .
0 the furniture is worn and dirty .
0 the room smelled like an ash tray .
0 this has happened the last _num_ out of _num_ times i visited this location .
0 all honesty , you are better off going somewhere else or a different location .
0 i will not be bringing it back any time soon .
0 i ended up getting the parts off line and had them installed elsewhere .
0 anything more than an oil change , i would n't trust them .
0 i can not trust them .
0 i do not recommend .
0 horrible place , the lobby is dirty and the workers are rude .
0 this hotel has the worst customer service that i have ever seen .
0 they were rude and the room was n't clean .
0 this place is a nightmare .
0 the price is appealing but not worth it .
0 the room i was given has water damage in the ceiling near the window .
0 i asked for a refund and left immediately .
0 if i could give it _num_ i would .
0 more midnight traffic than a _num_ hour dennys .
0 the bed was very uncomfortable !
0 the entire place was just filthy !
0 oh , and the free breakfast was nothing more than dry cereal and juice .
0 the milk pitcher was never once refilled .
0 i will never return to this dump ever again !
0 it had fallen on the floor .
0 it made me worry what smell they were trying to cover up .
0 but , for the extremely low price ... what did i expect .
0 i would n't go back , that 's for sure .
0 for last minute we had the one queen bed room and it was awful .
0 the carpet was dirty and the room was extremely dusty .
0 very outdated on the inside .
0 shower was covered in soap scum .
0 spend a few dollars more and stay away .
0 something must have happened because i was very disappointed last night .
0 the boneless short ribs was a bad , bad choice for the appetizer .
0 and sushi is sushi is sushi if they are rolled correctly .
0 however , the service was not up to par today .
0 i know that the economy has been hard on everyone , but whoa .
0 now , i 'm going to update my review from my _num_ review .
0 menu is pretty standard as far as hibachi grill food items goes .
0 so , this was definitely a reason to try this restaurant out .
0 so , lets get back to the menu .
0 steam rice on the other hand is free ( which i picked ) .
0 fried rice : eggs , sesame seed , and soy sauce .
0 no green onions , carrots , and all that other good stuff .
0 and mind , i ate two of my party 's portion on noodles .
0 the tempura , i had no taste for it .
0 the batter had no taste , as well as the sauce .
0 that 's not it !
0 however , the salmon was not good .
0 it fell apart and had bones in it .
0 i first ordered salmon sashimi and then got salmon nigiri instead .
0 overall , i was not impressed with the food but liked the people .
0 the miso soup was hot but the taste only average .
0 the service was bad as well !
0 it was absolutely too much .
0 there is not much of a raw roll selection .
0 i am used to more creativity in rolls and this place was lacking .
0 one of the pieces i received was totally different from what i ordered .
0 we would not go again , having experienced far better .
0 sorry i wo n't recommend .
0 the food does n't have any flavor .
0 the sushi guy has major attitude .
0 the sushi is not worth your time .
0 it had carrots in it .
0 then they brought out my fried rice .
0 it was n't the display chef 's fault !
0 another co-worker who ordered a combo was given the wrong food .
0 i immediately noticed how unfriendly the sushi `` chef '' was .
0 what struck me so quickly was how thin the sashimi was cut !
0 when i mean thin , i mean thin enough to see through the slice !
0 this `` chef '' is blatantly trying to rip people off .
0 while the atmosphere was nice , i did not enjoy the food .
0 it was probably the least delicious hibachi i have ever been to .
0 i would not recommend this hibachi .
0 our chef was lacking any kind of personality or energy .
0 maybe i came on a bad night ?
0 i begin to munch on my fries and they were lukewarm .
0 the milk shake was taking long so i begin eating my room temp nuggets .
0 nasty , hate this place .
0 do n't understand why people are obsessed with nasty fried chicken .
0 busy is not an excuse for under cooked food .
0 i canceled my membership and they lost a customer for life .
0 way to keep business drew .
0 the vending machine for free samples was broken the last two times i went .
0 my last visit they ran out of shopping carts .
0 i am not kidding - this is no joke .
0 when i walked up everyone was busy with customers .
0 it was actually painfully slow .
0 unfortunately , one of these items required a return for an even exchange .
0 i quickly advised the associate this was totally unacceptable and bring a manager immediately .
0 i again insisted on speaking to a member of management .
0 another associate handled the actual exchange transaction .
0 more business than they wish to handle .
0 it certainly was not me .
0 the return policy is horrible !
0 stay away from sales person kevin .
0 ordered online , waited a month for delivery date .
0 day comes and they miss the _num_ hour delivery window .
0 they call me and extend the window .
0 then they do n't show up until _num_ hours later !
0 no one called , no apologies .
0 asked if they would guarantee it would be here this time ?
0 just the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
0 staff is extremely rude and unprofessional .
0 the company never responded to my questions in the store or online .
0 worst delivery experience ever .
0 i called customer service and they were zero help .
0 do not do business with this company .
0 i have experienced poor customer service and shady salespeople .
0 it 's difficult to do business with a company that you do not trust .
0 they never were opened and nothing was applied to the furniture .
0 do not buy this couch !
0 total waste of _num_ $ !
0 they will be extremely rude and give you the run around .
0 i have never been so disrespected from a customer service rep .
0 also products are crappy also .
0 in fact , just about everything here tasted like something else .
0 so my money is on the lotus buffet .
0 the first time was so-so , the second time was better .
0 ( gross out side note : their bathrooms need better ventilation .
0 literally the worst chinese buffet i have ever been to .
0 vegetables limp and overlooked .
0 all sauces were too sweet and most tasted the same .
0 it was n't even warm .
0 i have no idea how this has n't failed a health inspection .
0 not the worst chinese i 've had , but definitely not the best .
0 good for a cheap lunch , but very americanized selection .
0 greasy unappetizing fried food .
0 decent food if you 're not a chinese food enthusiast .
0 low quality food but the $ _num_ lunch special makes it worth it .
0 had the $ _num_ lunch and it was exactly what i expected .
0 not a great selection of food .
0 last week i stopped by to get the battery of my watch changed .
0 are you kidding me ?
0 it pains me to write this review .
0 $ _num_ and $ _num_ is not consistent !
0 he was just trying to rip me off again .
0 i was recently at this store to make an expensive jewelry purchase .
0 there is no sense of customer service at this store .
0 the dental hygienist was very rude .
0 never before have i encountered such unprofessional service at a doctor 's office .
0 i will not be going back to this doctor .
0 wow , what a bad experience .
0 she , with no hesitation , denied me any medication for the pain .
0 i was suffering and she had zero compassion for me .
0 i paid my bill and left and refused to make another appointment .
0 i do not recommend this dentist .
0 she 's a rip off !
0 it 's probably cause its just meant for sports and drinks .
0 but for those who like drinks and sports this would be your spot !
0 ugly dcor , bad food , poor service .
0 the service is terrible !
0 i did n't get one smile from either bartender .
0 when it came out it was missing cheese and had _num_ onion slice .
0 i will not go again .
0 well since no one would wait on us , we left .
0 smells terrible weird mixture of nail polish and sour beer .
0 and the food was bad .
0 all the pasta for our party was undercooked ; there were _num_ of us .
0 other customers also were returning meals .
0 all _num_ entrees ( big family ) ordered were served cold .
0 not warm , not luke warm , cold !
0 i had two items : a caesar salad , and a margherita pizza .
0 the cheese was ok , the tomatoes were flavorless .
0 it was covered with chopped green herbs .
0 i had n't been to a macaroni grill in a number of years .
0 i most likely wo n't be back to one for a very long time .
0 my wife got mama 's trio .
0 she did n't really care for any of it .
0 the worst macaroni grill i 've ever been to !
0 do not waste your time !
0 another ordered the fried calamari appetizer ( $ _num_ ) .
0 this was a disappointment .
0 another of us ordered the chicken parm ( $ _num_ ) .
0 their close proximity does n't win out over quality .
0 hello new owners ; this is a recipe for disaster .
0 `` if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . ''
0 do they have a corporate taste kitchen ?
0 it was a bucket of dry pasta with some cheese and meat .
0 a poached egg on top ?
0 not the way to do it .
0 besides , the egg pasta was too thick .
0 do not waste your money .
0 i had an italian mojito which i do n't recommend , period ... blech .
0 i would n't get it again .
0 worst dining experience ever .
0 _num_ minutes in , he finally gets our drink orders .
0 _num_ minutes in , finally takes our damn order .
0 first one , no dressing .
0 when my food finally came , it was all lacking in flavor .
0 i did n't see my bill , and was told everything was taken off .
0 overall , i would never dine here again .
0 we were visiting friends in charlotte and chose macaroni grill to meet .
0 the restaurant was practically empty on a sunday afternoon when we met .
0 everything else ( except the friends ) was disappointing .
0 this was a work lunch so i had to attend .
0 hostess greeted the group quickly and was ready to seat us .
0 not a great presentation of the dining area .
0 tough , clearly overcooked , and just downright horrible .
0 will not be visiting again .
0 the brick chicken did n't taste fresh .
0 it was like a fast food chicken with that really dried out taste .
0 anyway , i totally can not remember what i ate here.
0 thought the staff was incredibly rude .
0 after we were seated and ordered our food did not all come out together .
0 even the salads were watery and bland .
0 so i picked this place to change his mind .
0 _num_ minutes later our order gets put in .
0 _num_ minutes later our appetizer comes out .
0 i guess she figured we were new and did n't know any better .
0 okay so the app was meh , main entrees yay !
0 he ordered a pork dish and i had lobster ravioli .
0 and it tasted so microwaved .
0 soup was served cold with basil leaves which were dry .
0 pasta was ok but too greasy .
0 please avoid this restaurant !
0 it is not worth the time or money .

0 tables were all dirty and the drink station was sticky and not very sanitary .
0 this is the second time this has happened in less than a month .
0 so i made sure the door was locked .
0 this is an email i received from what seems to be the manager .

0 also note they lie when you fight it with your bank .
0 same price by the airport and your in a luxury .
0 do n't trust this pace .

0 my room was n't clean when we got back to the hotel .
0 i would not stay here again .
0 exercise equipment and some of the dryers and washing machine were broken .

0 however , you have no set vet there , as far as i know .
0 small dogs may be different .
0 there is no reason that they should n't have caught that he was dying .

0 confusion on the phone over what they did or did n't have available .
0 big mistake because he did n't check the food .
0 the tenders had no seasoning on them .

0 i attempted to order an ultimate steakhouse martini with kettle one .
0 the bartender was the worst experience of the night .
0 extremely inattentive , uninterested and not warm .
0 i 'm not an idiot , i can see that .
0 i was immediately disgusted .
0 i assume she was the general manager .
0 when she returned it was only a bill for the martini .
0 i am utterly surprised they did not compensate my entire meal .
0 it was flavorless and i had to add a ton of salt .
0 my server was nice , but not friendly at all .

0 i 've been craving breadsticks since i picked up some from target .
0 i could n't eat it after the first piece .
0 bland $ _num_ of waste !
0 on average probably twice a month .
0 several times they 've screwed my order up , often leaving ingredients off completely .
0 so tonight i called my order in ( i usually do it online ) .
0 but hey , that 's just me .
0 anyway , that 's not even why i 'm upset .
0 his reply was that he did n't see it .
0 i reply that i assure him that i 'm not lying about it .
0 delivery even on busy nights like saturday is faster than the others .
0 it 's the execution that lacks .
0 luckily i do n't mind coke ... .
0 i really have no idea what it is .
0 the dining room always looks closed .
0 i really did n't know what i was supposed to expect .
0 i wo n't be going back .
0 then , i went again and it was a different story .
0 like a cup of water mixed condiments was poured on the burger .
0 at this point i was angry .
0 if you want a surprise burger , go to this bk .

0 pulled off to the same freaking messed up order !
0 the sesame chicken was just okay , as was the general and orange chicken .
0 chicken was way over cooked .
0 tried this place because i was referred by a friend .
0 i really wish i could rate the complex individually .
0 however , the worst part about this complex is the front office .

0 they are incompetent with their jobs .
0 they can not answer simple billing questions , or requests .
0 stop apologizing and fix the problem !
0 shape was uneven and no attention to details whatsoever .

0 standard italian food - nothing i could buy at the grocery store .
0 my spaghetti was watery and had barely enough sauce to coat the watery noodles .
0 issue # _num_ : i ordered the chicken parm sub with fries .
0 the sandwich itself was mediocre .
0 not my ideal chicken parm !

0 no problem , they included tax .
0 umm , why the double tax ?
0 if not for the nice waitress , would have been _num_ star .
0 this place is gross .

0 hardly worthy of mention here a decade later .
0 food was not good on three occasions .
0 my children ordered chicken nuggets , they were burnt .

0 no stars would be correct .
0 this place wo n't be around for too much longer i 'm sure .
0 went for dinner , service was terrible , food was worse .
0 salmon was so dry it was difficult to cut much less eat .
0 too many good restaurants in charlotte to waste time and money here .
0 she said she would get it changed .
0 almost immediately she came back and said her manager refused to change our bill .
0 could n't even finish it , which says a lot for friday happy hour .
0 it 's sad that the food is so bad .
0 unfortunately , that 's not enough to bring us back .
0 there are _num_ restaurants within walking distance of our apartment .
0 i would rate a _num_ .
0 bottom line is , do n't do it .
0 i told him `` just remember , it 's not their fault they suck .
0 just does n't cut it .
0 advertised as italian , olive garden should be offended .
0 did not stick around to argue .

0 sorry but you guys deserve a _num_ .
0 service was slow and the restaurant was not crowded .
0 the server kept forgetting to bring requested items , mixed everyone 's orders up .
0 ordered the lasagna and got mush instead .
0 it was a pile of cheese in a sea of grease .
0 wo n't be visiting there again .
0 our waitress was very friendly but slow .
0 food is over priced and not very good .
0 all _num_ in our party was n't pleased with the food .
0 drinking here might not be bad but eat before you go !
0 the private room we were in was nice but cold .
0 it was overcooked and turned gray .
0 they were cut too thin and therefore hard to control the cooking temperature .
0 as a result they came out overcooked .
0 they , again , were not cooked to medium ... overcooked to medium well .
0 they were not seasoned well .
0 a good steak never requires steak sauce .
0 _num_ ) the private room was great but never warmed up .
0 _num_ ) the server was as good as you could ever ask for .
0 _num_ ) the food was lackluster .
0 and the breakfast is n't very good at all .
0 i 'm just not impressed with their breakfast .
0 my real issue is with the eggs they served me .
0 they were burnt and cooked down to nothing .
0 honestly it looked like one scrambled egg to me .
0 the salmon was way over seasoned , over cooked and had a suspicious smell .
0 since it is so close i will probably return for drinks but not food .
0 servers are awesome , the food is a hole in a wall quality .
0 not happening again , because i 'm never going back again .
0 no `` thank you '' or `` have a good day '' .
0 i can not tell you how mad this company makes me .
0 the next thing i know , i am in collection for $ _num_ .
0 i mean , this could cost me for a long time .
0 so here is the kicker that makes me even more mad .
0 however , here is how they contacted me .
0 then i wait for someone to come on the line .
0 absolutely terrible service to have a phone system like this .
0 it 's not worth it .
0 poor results and questionable billing .
0 requested a meeting and no one showed up .
0 they will not communicate with a simple phone call .
0 the produce was n't always kept up well either .
0 the only thing harris teeter has to offer is a better coupon policy .
0 i left _num_ minutes after arrival .
0 ordered cashew chicken , hot and spicy beef and kung pao chicken .
0 never ever will i order from here again .
0 i have one shoe which the sole is falling off .
0 what 's worse , i found a scratch on the side later .
0 this place is overrated .
0 the food is no better then the other burrito places in uptown .
0 you also get lip from the owner if you want to pay credit .
0 at that point it goes from mildly amusing to uncomfortable and rude .
0 no big deal for my me or my wallet .
0 but it left a bad taste in my mouth .
0 not a word in _num_ months .
0 i 've walked in to make purchases .
0 i 'm usually met with `` next register .
0 no one seems to care .
0 this is really frustrating .
0 the contacts have small print and does not allow you to cancel your service .
0 and she was doing me a favor and hung up on me !
0 unbelievably poor service and super expensive on top of that .
0 this company 's contract is very frustrating to work with .
0 overpriced and my muffin was stale .
0 not worth the $ _num_ i spent on the muffin and coffee .
0 will not go again .
0 really , not good .
0 i was so disappointed .
0 strange looking , and bad tasting .
0 not good at all .
0 so that was a strange start .
0 i would n't stay there again for what it cost .
0 please do not see this vet .
0 if i could give this place zero stars i would .
0 this place is terrible .
0 probably the rudest receptionist and office staff we have ever encountered .
0 i walked in and was told it was a 30-40 minute wait .
0 at that time , one of the hair stylist went out back .
0 of course after having a smoke break , she reeked of smoke .
0 i could not use the pay at the pump feature with a credit card .
0 so she is choosing one paying customer over another .
0 was pleasantly greeted on the phone and my order was taken down promptly .
0 i payed $ _num_ for a large cheese pizza .
0 the pizza was nice and hot , but was mediocre in taste .
0 not many people in there tonight so the selection of pizza seemed minimal tonight .
0 the pizza now is just ok .
0 i have had a meatball sub and stuffed shells and they are both ok .
0 unfortunately , i was let down .
0 i was told _num_ min .

0 it took _num_ hours and our pizza was cold .
0 i sucked it up and ate _num_ pieces of pizza and _num_ wings .
0 the pizza was flavorless and the crust tasted like cardboard .
0 needless to say , i will never go back to papa john 's again .
0 no way are they that busy that early in the mornings .
0 if i could give this place a negative _num_ , i would .
0 it looked like microwaved pizza and it tasted terrible , cardboard like .
0 i do n't get how they use better ingredients and it tastes terrible .
0 the worst thing about coming to fort mill is this mcdonald 's .
0 the service is awful .
0 you might ask `` how do you mess up a cup of coffee ? ''
0 that 's not how i ordered it .
0 the parking lot is a bit weird to access .
0 i did n't check the bathrooms .
0 this particular store sets the bar to a new low .
0 i will never be back .
0 employees are unbelievably rude most of the time .
0 on the bed , there are a couple of dead roaches .
0 however , the doors are closed and locked shut .
0 the spot we stayed in was quite long , and very level .
0 no frills , but not expensive either .
0 thank goodness we did n't have to use the bathrooms , beyond sketchy !
0 not at all impressed .
0 yes bar - no one under _num_ allowed .
0 really only space for our 5th wheel .

0 _num_ minutes later , they appeared .
0 it took just over _num_ minutes for the food to arrive .
0 they were all crisp , no potato , and no flavor .
0 my wife 's veggie sandwich was very plain .

0 i said attempt because they did n't have much to offer .
0 i pointed out that there is a grocery store within walking distance .
0 the reply was the owners wo n't let us buy anything .
0 _num_ ) ok everyone can have a bad day so we returned this sunday .
0 once again they were out of things but not as bad as last week .
0 there is much more that i can say but this is already a novel .

0 the service is usually mediocre but last night was absolutely terrible .
0 it so deserves less than minus !
0 he refused to give me anything but the store number !
0 and this office have very bad customer service nobody say hey nobody help .

0 the pool was empty ( no water ) mid may .
0 so glad i did n't send the kids on ahead to the pool .
0 no one bothered to tell us that the pool was out of commission .
0 anyone could just walk right up to that empty pool and fall in .
0 however , it is in the process of being renovated .
0 in its current state , i would not recommend it .

0 waited _num_ minutes for them to check me into someone else 's room .
0 _num_ more minutes and finally someone came up front .
0 they checked me into someone else 's room .
0 this new room stinks of cigarette smoke , it 's filthy inside .
0 avoid this place at all costs .
0 still the general manager has not returned a phone call or a text message .
0 still no contact from the general manager !
0 the room was clean and the air was cold .
0 i would def look elsewhere before i booked here .

0 luckily for me , i live in rock hill .
0 secondly , there were ants everywhere !
0 the room was very small and was not worth the amount we paid .
0 plus , no free wifi !
0 this is by far the worst motel _num_ i 've ever stayed in .
0 eggplant parm was salty .
0 veal parm was tough and so thin .

0 i have had better and i have had worse .
0 the guacamole is always bland .
0 our waiter greeted us nearly as soon as we walked through the door .
0 the salsa , although bland , was surprisingly spicy .
0 becky noticed it too .

0 only people in the place and the waitress messed up a simple order .
0 chili verde was ok but not worth $ _num_ .
0 husband had chicken & cheese enchiladas and said they were bland .

0 rude customer service in beer section .
0 called me a liar when i said the beer was stale .
0 it was an expensive craft beer .
0 they need to check their dates and stop selling stale , overpriced beer !
0 the vendor did n't stock your shelves , fool !
0 just want people to understand truth in advertising .
0 would not suggest this place to anyone .
0 especially do not go here if you are a craft beer drinker .
0 for a destination dinner , i think not .
0 it 's just not enough to keep us coming anymore .
0 this place has went downhill bad .
0 the food is pretty mediocre .

0 not hot and sorta greasy .
0 wife got salad , which was unimpressive and a little wilted .
0 it appeared to be pan fried , as is was greasy .
0 it was a very poor cut of meat , with much fat and gristle .
0 you pay for a choice cut of meat and get waffle house food .
0 i went to this place probably _num_ years ago .
0 was not impressed then .
0 we all went home after and did n't feel like doing anything after this .
0 the inside smells horrible ... like old and soggy and dusty .

0 without fail its always the same .
0 poor to standard food .
0 con 's : outdated decor and seating , average food to sub par food .

0 today was the worst , though .
0 i felt bad for the hostess .
0 gone downhill from the last time i was here .
0 turned out to be a big disappointment .

0 chicken was dry and the portions were tiny !
0 nope ... no where to be found on the menu .
0 after one person took a bite the sour faces were hard to miss !
0 after kindly explaining this to my waitress she again was not very professional .
0 she offered free desert which we did not want because everything else was terrible .
0 the wrong people are running it .
0 one exception -- the ribs are not bad and edible !

0 decor looks like you have time traveled to _num_ .
0 but i wo n't be back .

0 it 's fishy , but it 's not coming from the lake .
0 that was pretty lame .
0 my husband was so confused with his sandwich .
0 it was half a loaf of mini bread with no knife .
0 it 's dirty , overpriced and the service is poor .
0 nice location , but i will never go back again .
0 but the food is horrible .
0 every appetizer and main dish is horrible .
0 beer selection is better in my house .
0 the manager made no effort and allowed me to walk away furious .
0 i was not the only patron who appeared to have trouble with their order .
0 simply because of the view i would only go there for a drink .
0 cocktails were good but menu is very overpriced .
0 service was just ok .
0 very musty , all the decorations appear to be from the early _num_ 's .
0 you can tell that the place is wiped down but never deep cleaned .
0 tasted nothing like a carolina burger should .
0 the chili was tasteless .
0 the bun was tasteless .
0 bad all the way around .
0 which i 'll gladly pay for a fresh ground beef patty .

0 horrible service ... my husband 's steak came to the table raw !
0 never checked on , offered additional drinks or dessert .
0 no apologies for uncooked food !
0 unfortunately it 's not one of my favorites .
0 to start , the hostess ' were not very welcoming when we walked in .
0 no smile , no hi , nothing .
0 so at this point we were a little taken back but continued in .
0 just not my kind of place .
0 i went as part of a group so did not really have a choice .
0 it was hot - very uncomfortable - inside .
0 it was loud - very loud - as usual .
0 the staff is very friendly so that 's why they get _num_ stars .
0 the owners do nothing to attempt fixing it up .
0 the food is n't very good at all .
0 if i could give it no stars , i would .
0 the place was so disgusting that i had to look up their restaurant rating .
0 after waiting for a boat slip for _num_ minutes , we finally get in .
0 we really did n't care where we sat .
0 we have kids that need to eat and are getting cranky .

0 when did simply enjoying the company of your companions fall out of favor ?
0 too salty to finish .
0 i ordered a _num_ oz .
0 for dessert , we shared a peanut butter pie with chocolate sauce .
0 it 's not bad , but it 's not spectacular .
0 last time i ate there was the last time .
0 mushy , times before food was much better .
0 her steak was over cooked and dry .
0 i made the mistake of sending mine back .
0 he had a replacement steak that was just the same as the first .
0 needless to say , i will not return .
0 my steak tonight was small in size and one third of it was gristle .
0 inconsistent service but food is good .
0 the place always seems busy whether it is happy hour or sunday dinner .
0 the waitress was a good server so this is solely on tonight 's food .
0 when anything on the salad is bad , you lose .
0 i could n't chew the steak .
0 i just was not going to eat it as i could n't chew it .
0 i did n't want to talk to the manager .
0 i was just going to pay for it and leave .
0 his ribs were refrigerator cold .
0 i 've already taken the meal off . ''
0 at that time my husband said he chicken was really good .
0 we told her just to charge us whatever and we were ready to leave .
0 i did n't feel the manager was apologetic although she had comped our meal .
0 she did n't come to our table and apologize for the ribs or chicken .
0 i would have felt better if she had said that she was sorry .
0 our visit on may _num_ was less than stellar .
0 only came back once to fill our drinks .
0 my aunt thought she went on a break and did n't bother telling us .
0 wish i would have chosen some place better to bring my family .
0 will not be back .
0 not worth the price for the lousy service we received .
0 do n't expect great results no matter how much money you spend .
0 after all that , the treatment didnt work at all .
0 too bad the man who answers the phone was rude as all heck .
0 cut me off while talking , was not listening , their loss .
0 i would n't even bother calling it 's not worth the time .
0 what an obnoxious , customer unfriendly person .
0 i would n't even give this place one star .

0 would not go hear again .
0 they do not take american express as a side note .
0 and they taste like cooking oil .
0 cheese curds , i 've had better .
0 cod , very dry and still had bones in it .
0 the guy at the register took my money , did n't say anything else .
0 seriously the worst pizza hut i 've ever ordered from .
0 it should n't take more than an hour to make and deliver a pizza .
0 this is a store that could really use a face lift .
0 the produce quality was not very good .
0 produce could use a makeover .
0 as an added bonus , the ethnic section is a joke .
0 can we please have a new grocery store already ?
0 the prices , however , are my biggest beef .
0 now and then they run a sale : _num_ for $ _num_ .
0 ... hey , how about you just lower your frickin ' prices ?
0 i 've never encountered a company with such an astounding lack of customer service .
0 just about half the price of the `` promotion '' the representative offered me .
0 transfer _num_ , to sales !
0 transfer _num_ , to the internet !
0 transfer _num_ , to the phone representative ( again ) !
0 transfer _num_ , to sales ( again ) !
0 there should be a negative rating on here .
0 it 's not theirs to make sure it work .
0 they said they could n't do anything better than their listed rate .
0 that is how much i hate them .
0 i have called _num_ times and received incredibly poor service .
0 avoid this company like the plague .
0 needs more books and homeless people .
0 sides of hot baked potato and basic iceberg lettuce salad were fine .
0 waitress amber was courteous and attentive .
0 if true i am disappointed , al .
0 boo , bad customer service and not worth the food .
0 we get the salads and app right away which was mediocre at best .
0 the waitress says she sorry and puts a quick order in right away .
0 btw they ordered chicken strips and fries so not very hard to make .
0 long story short very disappointed with service and food .
0 i wo n't be back .
0 the food was barely warm .
0 the food is usually good , but today we got the worst service ever .
0 the employees inside had no idea that there was an order matching our number .
0 maybe someone gave our order to another customer .
0 he requested his money back .
0 people walked in after us and were seated .
0 not sure what their structure is for seating , but they suck at it .
0 i will not be back .
0 the place is full of regulars drinking cheap beer .
0 but still way way too crowded .
0 then someone came over and said hi .
0 so she then tried to help things along .
0 tried sitting outside and the waitress did not make us feel welcomed .
0 she was rude and careless .
0 we walked inside to the bar where the bartenders were a lot better .
0 seems like they have enough customers and do not need to be nice anymore .
0 too bad because the beer was nice and cold .
0 there were n't many patrons in the dining room .
0 needless to say , i will not be returning .
0 service was slow , just getting a drink was an effort .
0 no way coming back other than drinks in the summer .
0 ate there last night with a group of friends .
0 it was cold and tasted very old .
0 the fries that went along with it were also extremely salty .
0 now , not worth the salt .
0 we had a horrible experience here last summer .
0 decided to give a chance again this summer and it 's worse !
0 wait staff is not trained .
0 this had not been discussed at the time of booking a few hours earlier .
0 i was there on monday december _num_ , _num_ .
0 when it was not on , we went back to the counter .
0 no one was there .
0 i waited another _num_ minutes .
0 tried this because it 's local .
0 terrible , bland chinese food .
0 not much else to say .
0 no , i just got home .
0 it was another _num_ minutes before i received the correct order .
0 no offer of a refund .
0 i tried to ask for some , but she walked away .
0 the meal was very disappointing to say the least .
0 the wait staff were completely absent outside of delivering the food .
0 took four kids tonight and we were all underwhelmed .
0 the chicken egg drop soup was oddly sweet .
0 even the dipping sauce just tasted like soy sauce .
0 the calamari was not tough .
0 fool me once , shame on you .
0 fool me twice , shame on me .
0 the service was also slow .
0 they refilled our glasses only once , after we had asked for the check .
0 i wo n't be going back .
0 the entree my dining companion ordered was also sub-par .
0 our chicken sizzling rice soup was flavor less and completely watered down .
0 the staff was very kind but a little annoying .
0 this is the worst chinese food my entire family has had in years .
0 we all ordered different things and none of us could eat our meals .
0 that was $ _num_ wasted .
0 how do you mess up beef fried rice ?
0 the mongolian beef had a flavor but it was all wrong .
0 how do places keep getting good reviews when they are so bad .
0 so that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering .
0 there was hardly any meat to be had .
0 all in all an extreme disappointment .
0 we ended up tipping and not making a fuss ... just another lesson learned .
0 the egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer .
0 the same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon .
0 not spicy enough , and far too sour .
0 it was also very greasy and watery , and tasted extremely bland .
0 waited a full _num_ hours for our food .
0 talking to friends over the weekend , we were told it was pretty good .
0 pot stickers - both steamed and fried - which were pretty good .
0 for hours - over two to be exact .
0 flavors were safe and my spicy shrimp was n't very spicy at all .
0 she complained and the waitress brought out a side of broccoli .
0 that is not true at all !
0 i do not recommend this place .
0 the food was bland , lukewarm and it had texture .
0 it was n't chicken , and it definitely did n't taste like chicken .
0 for everyone that gave this place more than one star .
0 however , lately they have fallen out of bed .
0 old , old fruit for my garnish in my drink .
0 for the price , they should have cut fresh fruit .
0 i 'm a little confused .
0 it 's basically the typical americanized , overpriced sit-down chinese restaurant .
0 the bbq pork in our appetizer was almost cold and chewy .
0 other items on the appetizer platter were okay , but lacked seasoning .
0 our entrees were n't much better .
0 the very odd thing about the sauce was that it was too sweet .
0 service was very poor , the minute we stepped in .
0 the restaurant had several empty tables .
0 the food was absolutely mediocre .
0 the only nice thing about this place is the ambiance .
0 unfortunately the quality of the food is quite low .
0 the rice , for instance , was the worst i have ever eaten .
0 i do n't recommend this restaurant to anyone .
0 there are much better chinese restaurants in madison and they are cheaper !
0 service was very poor , the minute we stepped in .
0 the restaurant had several empty tables .
0 the food was absolutely mediocre .
0 i literally just walked out of the establishment .
0 she was hesitant to give me a straight up answer .
0 she said ummm not really !
0 she needs more training in customer service .
0 ate here once with a buy one , get one coupon .
0 i wo n't be heading back .
0 beans were ok , rice , not so much .
0 i probably wo n't be back .
0 not enough servers at their new location .
0 if you go when it 's busy , beware .
0 this was somewhat disturbing seeing as they are constantly touching dirty plates and towels .
0 the chips ... kinda bad .
0 super weird consistency and zero salt .
0 our second basket was better , but still lacking .
0 the salsa was ok ... not amazing but not bad .
0 he said no problem .
0 i 'm eating very slowly because i want that hot sauce .
0 it 's now been probably _num_ min since my margarita came .
0 bottom line , drinks : yay !
0 it was a certified used vehicle so it was still under warranty .
0 i just wish that 's who we would 've went to first .
0 his level of customer service was appalling .
0 i complained but got nowhere .
0 it is $ _num_ just to walk in the door .
0 _num_ - the locker rooms are old and sort of creepy .
0 you probably are n't either .
0 am i going to stop going there as a result ?
0 no , it 's too convenient .
0 the lava cakes were barely cooked and therefore inedible .
0 the pizza was not bad .
0 which i guess explains the attitudes of the staff .
0 this michael 's location is a disaster .
0 they do n't have really any good stores that make me stop and shop .
0 there really is no big draw .
0 on top of all this the location is horrible .
0 the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth .
0 service has always been very slow , despite _num_ baristas working at the counter .
0 horrible , horrible , horrible service .
0 slow , unfriendly staff who refuse to even talk to you sometimes !
0 i did not leave a tip .
0 they staff is friendly enough , but they are still a service biased company .
0 is annoying , but not the end of the world .
0 i think i even gave them good reviews in here before .
0 dude thought he should argue with me about it so i got a refund .
0 went there on saturday night to get some food to go .
0 on of the worst chinese buffets i 've seen .
0 half of the trays were empty and other half were almost empty .
0 that being said , i would not recommend the place to friends .
0 some of the food on the buffet is quite good .
0 not sure why i keep deciding to come back here .
0 this buffet is by far the worst buffet i 've ever been to .
0 the fried rice was only a little and old and hard .
0 waiting to see if they would bring any new food out ... but nope .
0 they would not bring any food out until dinner time which is 4pm .
0 we could n't stay and wait one more hour until they serve dinner .
0 and there was no other customers but us .
0 what a waste of money !
0 the worst part is , i got sick for _num_ days after .
0 this is just ridiculous in this day and age to not accept cards .
0 even worse is the bs sign on the register .
0 but seriously _num_ min for a slice of quiche and a breakfast sandwich ?
0 we told them just make the drinks , forget the food .
0 even so the drinks took _num_ minutes .
0 would not recommend until they work their production issues out .
0 hire another cook and install another stove .
0 but very slow service , and overpriced .
0 only takes cash or check !
0 i wo n't be wasting my money again .
0 i 'm confused why anyone would choose to go here .
0 i ordered the thai curry noodles .
0 i 've never tasted something that claimed to be curry with so little flavor .
0 my vegetables were obviously charred and they still sent me the dish .
0 not even the chili garlic sauce did much to it .
0 almost thought i was in los angeles again .
0 this is not very good asian food .
0 i would suggest that there must be a better choice in madison .
0 i am sure there are asians in madison .
0 i am sure chin 's would not be on their list .
0 i 've never dined in , so i wo n't comment on atmosphere .
0 for the most part , i 've had ok experiences with the food selections .
0 it 's nothing really special .
0 i ordered a shrimp and veggie stir fry to go .
0 yeah , next time i 'll get my own lunch .
0 i ate it but will definitely not go there again !
0 it fell short in ambiance and flavor for me .
0 i did n't feel like this had a lot of flavor .
0 it went on for about _num_ minutes and really made my stop there interesting .
0 after cream cheese wontons , pad thai is one of my favorite asian entrees .
0 dull gray , soupy , greasy , salty and watery , yet somehow sticky .
0 epic fail on this entree .
0 instead , however , they were the same brown color as the fried rice .
0 my last fortune cookie said i 'll probably return to chin 's .
0 we tried to order for delivery because we are _num_ miles away .
0 on their menu it says $ _num_ minimum .
0 i was n't paying for a meal twice and getting attitude from this guy .
0 not very friendly to start .
0 not very consistent with service or procedures .
0 i will not be back .
0 panda is doing better then this .
0 no sweet , no sour .
0 not so freshly made !
0 so we left never going back first and last !
0 i called to find out what was on the hot and spicy chicken .
0 on top of that , there was no broccoli .
0 it was cut so thin and had no chicken flavor .
0 i wo n't return there .
0 the service is less than stellar .
0 plus , i do n't care for the taste of their ice cream .
0 maybe it is just me , but i think it 's overrated .
0 the texture is far too gooey for my liking .
0 * flavor - the ice cream here is too sweet .
0 it 's really kind of a depressing place to visit now .
0 i do n't recommend going there .
0 my wife ended up waiting _num_ minutes for this .
0 as we were waiting , i noticed how dirty the entire interior was .
0 it looks like the floors and base boards have not cleaning in months .
0 i did not check the bathrooms , too scared to try .
0 it is a waste of time and money .
0 one was apple pie and the other was cheesecake .
0 it looks terrible does n't it ?
0 either i was _num_ ] not a regular or _num_ ] a bother .
0 darts , pool , tuesday blues night ( live blues band !
0 it 's not so bad , but it 's just not that good .
0 we had pizza there the other night and i could taste the freezer burn .
0 sorry , boar - the truth can hurt .
0 so yeah , no . ''
0 excuse me for wanting to try your establishment .
0 so disappointing that 's how people think a business should be run .
0 my latest visit was not the best .
0 fine ... no big deal , i got to use my coupon .
0 so much for being a loyal customer .
0 unfortunately we choose cousins .
0 we got there and ordered _num_ subs with fries and cheese curds .
0 it took us nearly _num_ minutes to get our food .
0 there were _num_ men making subs and taking orders , it was moderately busy .
0 it 's absolutely pathetic and borderline useless .
0 unfortunately , we were unable to drink this bottle of wine .
0 we took one sip and realized it was bad .
0 the nose was off , and so was the taste .
0 they have decent drink specials .
0 ive never had their food but ive heard its pretty decent .
0 overall it an ok place to go to get a few drinks .
0 sadly its one of the better bars in middleton .
0 little disappointed with my beer too .
0 there were maybe _num_ people there , all sitting at the bar .
0 maybe they only serve locals .
0 there were n't remotely interested in us or our business .

0 bisque was on the salty side , but it was ok with the bread .
0 i wish i could have stopped my meal here ... .
0 so i ordered that just to try the raspberry dressing , and huge disappointment .

0 i only ate the shrimp .
0 the service was soooooo slow that night .
0 then , it was an even longer wait to order dinner .
0 our empty plates sat on our table for _num_ minutes .

0 this marriott kind of feels like an airport hotel .
0 both hotels feature an open atrium that goes up _num_ to _num_ levels high .

0 had a hamburger wrap for meal which i did n't care for .
0 menu is typical bar food .
0 after a long while we realized she must have left for good !

0 the beer garden was out of the most popular styles .
0 shirt sizes in the gift shop were limited .

0 my expectations were not that high .
0 the food is mediocre , even for fast foot 's low standards .
0 i would give this bk a _num_ star if i could .

0 they just do n't seem to care .
0 avoid at all costs !
0 _num_ minutes to get my order .

0 not even worth one star !
0 i went through the drive through , with about _num_ cars ahead of me .
0 waste of my time and money !
0 everything at this bk takes ten minutes .
0 does n't matter what you order , be prepared to wait .
0 this place is a hole .

0 this place is slow beyond belief .
0 i waited _num_ min for my order which was wrong and cold .
0 worst bk i 've ever been to !
0 should take _num_ minutes to get a nice cream cone .
0 still very slow service at drive through .
0 no wonder there are never cars outside !
0 the cheese burgers are quite gross .
0 the cheese is what i imagine fake , fake cheese is like .
0 the chicken nuggets and sandwiches are also passable .
0 however i do not plan on visiting another burger king any time soon .
0 literally on even one croutons or slice of tomato nothing but shredded lettuce .
0 i let it ring about _num_ times and then hung up .
0 same deal : lots of ringing , no answering .
0 i let it ring another _num_ times or so and just gave up .
0 i do n't mind having someone answer and then immediately put me on hold .
0 it 's a lot better than the nothing that i got .
0 for a taco bell , this one is horrible .
0 this is the most amazingly slow drive through ever !
0 never , ever go here .
0 like over cooked and then sat out for a couple of hours .
0 then i drove back and went inside and i talked to the manager .
0 pointed out the problem and asked them if they would eat something like that .
0 doing some food prep for my job , i called bs on her .
0 in the end , would not recommend the taco bell .
0 instead of offering napkins the girl just shut the window & turned around .
0 taco bell back then only existed in south western states .
0 this is the worst taco bell i 've ever been to .
0 tonight we placed an order got home and half the order was wrong .
0 their food is terrible if you ever get it .

0 wait time in the drive thru runs between _num_ to _num_ minutes !

0 they told me it would be $ _num_ .
0 unfortunately at this location i was n't given a chance to get a pizza .
0 i walked into the store at _num_ minutes to 8pm .
0 you do n't even bake the pizza !
0 my first time at this location and was disappointing .
0 place was dirty and the worst pizza ever .
0 for $ _num_ that is a rip off , a joke and unacceptable !
0 boy , was i disappointed !
0 so that was ridiculous right off the bat .
0 sadly , this was not the case .
0 but i highly doubt we 'll make our way there any time soon .
0 ordered egg rolls , steamed dumplings , garlic beef and orange chicken .
0 the garlic beef was cold and the meat was very fatty .
0 extremely low quality chicken on the orange chicken .
0 food was just low quality .
0 so , i stand and wait .
0 not saying they had to immediately hand me my order , but come on !
0 do yourself a favor , avoid this place .
0 pretty bland for chinese take out .
0 this place is sort of gross .
0 next , the shopping experience was n't much better .
0 no one ever greeted me or asked if i needed help .
0 the inside of the building smells really bad .
0 i did not like my experience , and i wo n't go back .
0 but we would n't know because no one ever came to the counter .
0 we arrived around 4:30 p.m. and there was no one else in the deli .
0 not much interest in those , huh ?
0 it 's just not worth it .
0 the building has been recently remodeled because it burned .
0 it was 2pm on sat and dead .
0 no excuse for dirty .
0 the waitress was really nice , i think her name was sarah .
0 i 'm not joking .
0 it 's just a numbers thing at this point .
0 two of those came wrong again .
0 too little too late .
0 kids got hot dogs , ugh , just buy a better brand people !
0 unbelievable and with my little girl there .
0 food sucked and i through left overs and cake in garbage .
0 had n't been to this restaurant in yrs and will never go again !
0 i 'm not sure what all the rave reviews for this place are about .
0 you should never have to wait that long at a diner !
0 sorry , but it was .
0 the pita bread was not pita , but large tortilla .
0 needless to say , i will not be back again .
0 poor quality food , very typical american fare .
0 our server screwed up both our orders , would n't recommend to anyone .
0 warm old school feel is ruined by lack of food quality .
0 this location does not have good service .
0 any other kfc would be better .
0 well , my first time was typical mediocre kfc .
0 then i made the bold , yet stupid decision to dine here again .
0 the tv reception is absolutely horrible .
0 finally , after my pushing , she looked it up on my file .
0 i 'll buy my product there from now on .
0 the previous review i wrote was pretty bad .
0 the selection was slim to non .
0 the employees at this location vary from indifferent to pretty helpful .
0 no big deal , right ?
0 this was in no way faster than just going through a regular register .
0 having the last part be the worst part did n't help .
0 this is not unusual for wally world these days .
0 no one said a word .
0 i 'm not even sure they noticed .
0 could have been a bad day but will never come here again .
0 i wish i could leave zero stars , but that 's not an option .
0 so probably expecting too much .
0 i 'm embarrassed to be writing this review .
0 just be very cautious when dealing with this dr .
0 piss poor customer service doesnt even begin to cover it .
0 dont hire these people .
0 walked by , saw me , and kept going without any acknowledgement .
0 bottom line : this pharmacy has bad customer service .
0 i worked at a walmart pharmacy years ago , as a technician .
0 as with any retail business , employees come and go rather quickly .
0 she 's been there for _num_ years , she told me so .
0 it 's completely hit or miss with customer service .
0 all this time i 've managed to avoid them , except for once .
0 let me break it down for ya .
0 hide the powdered doughnuts . ''
0 i felt sorry for the bride and groom .
0 the place was not clean for starters .
0 the food was the worst part .
0 i had the sirloin , it was cold , chewy , and bland .
0 food is below average and pricey .
0 the place looks really good but i was really disappointed with their food .
0 almost everything sucks in their menu except the omelette and bacon .
0 omelette was one of the item which did n't disappoint me .
0 the maple syrup was n't up to the mark .
0 sausage and scrambled egg were okay .
0 cakes were n't good .
0 the staff were n't friendly enough .
0 they did n't even take care of us properly .
0 they were in bloody hurry always though it was just a brunch going on .
0 they were not changing or replacing the dishes on the buffet counter .
0 i did n't like the food and the service at this place .
0 i do n't know how it would be if i order from the menu .
0 but they did n't pull off the brunch properly .
0 the cost of the food was n't worth it at all .
0 it was a waste of money .
0 i left the place unsatisfied and disappointed .
0 additionally the fish was not hot , fishy tasting and overall not good .
0 we sat down and had to wait _num_ more minutes for a menu .
0 whatever the reason , this has not been an enjoyable experience .
0 do n't go in the drive thru if there are more than _num_ cars .
0 you will sit there for _num_ minutes .
0 bland burgers , bland hot dogs , and expensive as all get up .
0 so needless to say we did n't ask for a single sample .
0 next time we will not going back .
0 the cheddar tasted sweet ( i know , weird , right ? )
0 the port wine cheese spread was okay but nothing special .
0 clean , noisy room .
0 did not give ana or aaron discount as they said they would .
0 your just going to waste your money !
0 no , it is n't .
0 grey is grey and pink is pink .
0 even into high school in the 90s i continued to shop here happily .
0 i 'd even like to give you _num_ stars for effort .
0 it is difficult to even find one .
0 unfortunately , my insurance does not allow me to go many places .
0 i have really tried to avoid going again .
0 then i did it , i made an appointment .
0 evening , busy time .
0 ok , maybe they are a little late .
0 apparently another appointment was waiting .
0 no one bothered to tell me that they were running late .
0 i do not know , i do not know .
0 all in all , i 'd pass on this store .
0 might be the worst vinyl focused store i 've been into .
0 we are shopping on amazon tonight .
0 he tried to make me feel like it was my fault .
0 not going to spend money here again .
0 it was not appealing to me .
0 easily the worst chinese food that i 've eaten .
0 our general tso 's chicken was terrible .
0 very bland and overcooked .
0 the flavor was also very strange , and tasted like ketchup .
0 the crab rangoon were n't much better .
0 the interior of this joint is also disgusting .
0 wallpaper is peeling off the walls , and in general it looked filthy .
0 customer service was also really bad .
0 we stopped in around _num_ pm and it was completely dead .
0 only rice and onions .
0 especially if they request them !
0 ordered the mongolian beef combo and fried dumplings .
0 i 'm not sure what was delivered , but it was not mongolian beef .
0 wo n't eat here again .
0 the food was nasty .
0 the language barrier was rough as well .
0 to make matters worse the food was barely lukewarm .
0 i wo n't be ordering from this place again anytime soon .
0 beef curry was okay .
0 call them on their crap !
0 the staff sucks beyond rude .
0 should n't be in business .
0 do n't know how to make drinks .
0 do n't waste your time or money going to this place .
0 the nut job lady in the morning needs to be on meds .
0 the problem i have over and over is the service .
0 three times ive been in and every time they are under staffed .
0 tonight i ordered the chimichangas .
0 instead of one big one , you get two smaller ones .
0 they also offer flautas , i wonder if they 're just the same thing .
0 not sure what all the hype is about .
0 no vegetarian options , and staff always too busy and not personable .
0 they never check my online order !
0 i called an hour later and they had not even started to cook !
0 not worth the time !
0 fried rice included soy sauce and carrots only !
0 the chicken dishes had fat on the meat .
0 i had high hopes , and they simply could n't have fallen farther .
0 i had tofu mixed vegetables , which is my go-to .
0 the vegetables were not just mediocre quality , but clearly past their prime .
0 i 'm talking soggy , wilted , and literally , barely even edible .
0 in conclusion , poor quality food , questionable sanitation , very very limited seating .
0 i ordered takeout from here tonight .
0 i probably wo n't be going back here .
0 the soup was so bad , i could not finish it .
0 i would not feed it to company at my home .
0 i live _num_ minutes away , food took _num_ hours to get here .
0 i complained and they said they would make me more soup .
0 i will not go back to this hole in the wall dump .
0 this is the closet i 've come , much to my disappointment .
0 in my phoenix and dragon i had five `` jumbo '' shrimps .
0 which are really just average sized shrimp .
0 some one else mentioned in this that they do n't really have much crab .
0 i suppose the worst part was delivery time .
0 the confirmation email does n't come with a estimated delivery .
0 _num_ minute mark rolls around and we have n't gotten a call .
0 _num_ minutes later we 're still waiting .
0 a little less than _num_ minutes later and it arrives .
0 the driver apologized and it was still hot .
0 the food was so dry .
0 have to say i wo n't be ordering here again .
0 the food i received from china wok was dry and tasteless .
0 it was unprofessional and annoying to other residents of our building .
0 i wo n't order from here again , ever .
0 half way through there was a hair in my sub .
0 i will not go back to this place again .
0 bad business , bad service .
0 place is trashy ... so is the guy whose family owns the place .
0 this place is truly awful .
0 visited last saturday evening and nothing was `` good '' .
0 the food was very meh ... _num_ people dined .
0 the potato skins were so dried out they were mostly inedible .
0 not too thrilled with the value of a groupon from sports pub .
0 that was not the case .
0 biggest waste of $ _num_ i 've ever spent .
0 you really should n't even think of going here during lunch .
0 they have one cash register at the front of the store .
0 nothing more , nothing else .
0 i was really dissatisfied that not one was hot enough to eat .
0 i physically left my whole meal and tray on the table and walked out .
0 no amount of ketchup could make me eat it .
0 i will probably not go back to this location again .
0 this is the worst fast food franchise in town .
0 the drive through is slow .
0 the food is inconsistent .
0 worst bk i 've ever been to .
0 when i left the car behind me followed as well .
0 it does n't matter the time of day .
0 ordered chicken tenders they were out .
0 ok can we have four cheeseburgers no we are out of buns .
0 i ordered sausage croissant meal w coffee to go .
0 boy , did i regret doing that favor for her .
0 the employees seem slow , stupid , and lazy .
0 like they have no idea what they are doing .
0 running out of fries ?
0 looked online and saw it opens at _num_ am on weekdays .
0 they should close it down at this point .
0 cash only and they 're out of fries .
0 not a big deal , but did n't have cash .
0 second time i pull up , drive thru box is still broken !
0 i wait _num_ minutes to get to the window to order .
0 i wait three more minutes before driving away .
0 madison public health department had burger king hire a pest control company .
0 i , for one , will never be eating here .
0 customer service that is apathetic at best , rude at worst .
0 i just do n't care much today . ''
0 no eye contact , no smile .
0 this is typical of the service .
0 i was n't too bothered , as it rang up clearance price .
0 the fabric selection is not what it once was , either .
0 a store is pretty much worthless if you cant pay for the items .
0 so not a great visit but not the worst , either .
0 did n't want to spend time on me because of people behind me .
0 i wo n't return to this location .
0 she was a counter waiting to get cut .
0 much better burgers and sandwiches in madison for a much more reasonable price .
0 overall , one of the worst restaurant experiences for me .
0 staff was friendly and service was fairly prompt .
0 the food was merely average and the `` specially brewed '' beer was weak .
0 overall , the place tries too hard with its theme .
0 not a day to encourage diners to eat on the patio .
0 i got so sick and was throwing up after eating there !
0 and normally i never get sick to my stomach .
0 no , no , never , never , uh uh uh !
0 sorry to say , this place is a disaster .
0 the food was cold , overcooked , tasteless and a little scary .
0 if i could give no stars this would be the place that deserves it .
0 there were a handful of patrons ( certainly more staff than paying customers ) .
0 do n't waste you time here !
0 cheeseburger was not all that .
0 the sweet potato chips were n't much better ; too greasy and stale .
0 it was acceptable , but the taste was off .
0 the service was n't good either .
0 i will not be back .
0 i was sick for _num_ days after i eat one of their burgers .
0 instead , all they serve up here is hamburgers with fancy names .
0 i doubt it was a chef .
0 if you 're looking for paradise you wo n't find it here .
0 but i have had lame burgers there too .
0 if you are still reading ... .
0 i had the mini crab burgers and they were pretty good .
0 however , i was surprised by the reasonable beer selection and the nice menu .
0 the big problem with cheeseburger was the service .
0 finish eating , wait _num_ minutes for the check .
0 not going back , even though the food was fine .
0 greasy food , lazy service , flat soda .
0 for a place the is supposed to specialize in burgers they sucked !
0 i got the guacamole bacon burger .
0 it was tasty but the burger itself was overly greasy .
0 the drink service was incredibly slow , and the food service was okay .
0 a disappointing trip , and we likely wo n't be back anytime soon .
0 do n't waste your money or time .
0 awful , sums up my first impression of the place .
0 how hard is it to wipe off the booth .
0 portions are weak however .
0 a big mac would probably be as flavorful as the burgers served here .
0 first was the lack of caring when it came to the booth 's cleanliness .
0 second , i never got a refill on my soda .
0 for $ _num_ , i 'm sure jimmy could afford another glass of soda .
0 it took our waitress nearly _num_ minutes to collect come back with our bill .
0 she then acted annoyed that we did n't want something other than water !
0 i will not be coming back .
0 also , why close the bar _num_ minutes early ?
0 i 'm just beyond put off .
0 nobody was cleaning up the place !
0 our food was barely edible .
0 stay away from this restaurant until they fix their issues .
0 so the food was average , not great .
0 the service was rushed and unfriendly .
0 not worth the price .
0 however , the dishes we got were n't particularly good either .
0 i wish i could give this place no stars .
0 got sick from this place twice !
0 pretty unfortunate event ... .
0 worst italian we have ever had .
0 called to get takeout and was greeted by a nasty host .
0 we will never return to this restaurant for food .
0 horrible service , and sub-par food .
0 my stuff was stolen from my room .
0 going to file a police report .
0 pet friendly and low cost .
0 it 's ok for low cost , but keep your expectations low .
0 worst red roof inn i have ever stayed in .
0 bed comforter had dried stains on it as well .
0 it was absolutely gross .
0 if i could , i would give this place zero stars .
0 the front desk attendant was dead inside , and the room was absolutely disgusting .
0 we stayed here for _num_ nights this weekend .
0 our bathroom was disgusting .

0 i 'm beyond upset with red roof inn , madison .
0 please do not stay here .
0 the service is so annoying .
0 april _num_ i entered boston store in east town mall in madison wisconsin .
0 i said `` why do n't you have locks on the dressing room doors ?
0 she had no response to my question .
0 i believe this is every woman 's worst nightmare !
0 she did n't seem to care .
0 he may have known there were no locks and followed me into dressing room .
0 it was sub par and i returned it anyways .
0 doubt i 'll be back .
0 poor food handling practices !
0 i was really excited to try this place as the reviews were excellent .
0 we ordered a couple of beers and they were prompt but not really cold .
0 they looked like they had never been washed .
0 last i checked , those practices could send someone to the hospital !
0 we will not be going back !
0 i think i may have been wrong .
0 the show was good enough but everything else was just meh .
0 let 's begin with the parking situation .
0 there is no parking situation .
0 i think i am going to stick to that for this venue as well .
0 the seats are cramped and uncomfortable .
0 do n't even want to mention the bathrooms , dirty taps and awful popcorn .
0 but my biggest beef of all is the lack of reserved seating .
0 why make people wait outside for an hour or more to attend an event .
0 sorry , it is just stupid .
0 worst security at any venue i have ever experienced and way overpriced drinks .
0 $ _num_ for a double ?
0 personally , i will not be attending any other performances here .
0 i needed new glasses , so prescription in hand i went shopping for frames .
0 will not use them again .
0 if i could give zero stars i would .
0 i am very disappointed that my review today has to to be negative .
0 i returned a car today at hertz at the madison airport .
0 she could care less and was extremely rude .
0 i have never been treated so horribly before .
0 well , go here if you want inconsistent pricing and condescending management .
0 edit - the less expensive store was the highly rated park street location .
0 i have never been so poorly treated by any business , ever .
0 i will not be returning to any midas location ever again .
0 pain in the neck , right ?
0 the tech put the bulb in and apparently it blew almost instantly .
0 that 's just not right .
0 stayed on a business trip seeking to save money on the nightly rate .
0 skip the complimentary breakfast as the choices are slim and offerings looked old .
0 good location , low prices , below par rooms .
0 my room was dirty .
0 the rooms had a stale , mildew smell .
0 my blanket has burn holes in it .
0 breakfast was crappy and there are always shady people in the parking lot .
0 the service , however , needs help , literally .
0 the small staff could just not get people to tables quickly enough !
0 everyone was working hard , they just need more people !
0 we drank too much coffee with all this waiting .
0 it was pretty busy so we waited for maybe _num_ minutes before being seated .
0 $ _num_ off our bill .
0 worst experience in service we 've ever had !
0 manager is very inexperienced .
0 fix your wifi for _num_ stars .
0 the jambalaya and gumbo seemed blah to both of us .
0 obviously the cook does not know that .
0 nothing had a cajun seasoning to it .
0 they are probably fake reviews by friends .
0 owner says i am not cajun .
0 i , on the other hand had an absolutely pitiful shrimp po boy .
0 take a bite , and all you taste is bread .
0 it was ok buy upset my stomach .
0 cornbread was dense and moist ?
0 can i give zero stars ?
0 i did n't even get to eat .
0 we were very disappointed and will not be going back .
0 cashier was not friendly at all .
0 if yelp allowed no stars , that would be my rating for this motel .
0 my stay here was horrible .
0 the rooms were gross and the entire experience was uncomfortable .
0 i tried to contact corporate about it , but my concerns were ignored .
0 my stay was on feb _num_ , _num_ .
0 the receptionist was no help .
0 after trying several times , we requested a third room .
0 it was too late and we were tired so we just settled .
0 i wish yelp allowed negative stars .
0 if i was n't so tired i would of headed someplace else !
0 i could n't get out of this hole fast enough !
0 the decor was bland , to say the least .
0 i had selected motel _num_ based on my experience in california .
0 anything else i 've tired here has been sub-par .
0 the mushrooms in our enchilada were canned , and then burned .
0 they tasted like kool-aid ( but without adequate water ) and lacked tequila .
0 pedro 's was , unfortunately , the first place that i tried .
0 the food is edible , but it is by no means mexican .
0 all their food is canned process nonsense .
0 does anyone in madison consider this a great mexican food location ?
0 friends invite me for inexpensive margaritas .
0 uh huh , that 's right , i said it .
0 that is , your cheesy , americanized mexican food experience .
0 i tried the vegetarian tamale and it was nothing less than awful .
0 no cheese anywhere , no flavor , just hot .
0 unfortunately on this particular visit we did n't get a hot waitress .
0 no sour cream on my burrito as ordered but we 'll move on .
0 i could n't even finish my meal it was so boring and tasteless .
0 tamales were not good .
0 when i said no , my satisfaction was not questioned .
0 the west side location was way better .
0 half the time i 'm there they screw up my order .
0 server was really slow and did not seem to know the menu .
0 the dining area is extremely shabby : ripped cushions and dingy tables .

0 absolute worst mexican food i have ever eaten , period .
0 it 's like mexican food for people who do n't like mexican food .
0 i would rather eat taco bell , and i do n't like taco bell .
0 i tried the camarones wrap - big mistake .
0 the shrimp were barely warm and slimy .
0 so try the table guac , but give the shrimp wrap a pass .
0 so like i say , good news , bad news .
0 the decor is _num_ 's `` americanized mexico . ''
0 unfortunately , the machine was n't running .
0 they had been sitting out for awhile .

0 disappointment number one : the tortillas were dry and tasteless .
0 disappointment number two : the salsa was really sweet and thick .
0 it did n't taste fresh .

0 but no , i was still charged a flat rate of $ _num_ .
0 unfortunately , that ride was with union cab .
0 but then when _num_ minutes rolled around there was still no cab in sight .
0 i wish i 'd thought to get his cab number before leaving .
0 i wo n't make the mistake of using union cab again .
0 i am not impressed by their lack of concern for safety .

0 i would sooner walk everywhere then ever deal with this place again .
0 i wish they would be more consistent with their overall service .
0 first , the sandwich was exceptionally greasy .
0 second , the size of the burger was pathetic .
0 you 've got to be desperate to eat there .

0 it 's disappointing for the north side of town .
0 there are n't many options for `` fast '' food .
0 just like every other home depot .

0 the only downside was the waiter .
0 very expensive & the food is terrible .
0 we will not return to this chili 's location .
0 the `` bottomless '' salad never had an offer of a refill .
0 the server was nice but it was a disappointing meal .

0 until then , there is no point in shopping here .
0 also , the food court sucks .
0 no good eatery places here at all .
0 hmm , this mall needs a facelift .
0 the stores are awful .
0 i do not even walk down certain area .
0 a pedi place and a foot massage place next door to one another ?

0 i pay my $ _num_ bucks , and go out to get my car .

0 needless to say , i 'm really bummed and disgusted .
0 the employees are rude .
0 the product is over priced .
0 the people are rude !
0 no hello , no hi , how are you ?
0 but that is not a reason for employees to be rude to the customers .
0 the guys vacuuming out the cars got really rude with her .
0 the epitome of a crap chain .
0 why did i get talked into going here ?
0 this needs no explanation .

0 i really did not expect the food to be so bad .
0 the only good part was my daughter 's chicken fingers , fries and pepsi .

0 after i walk in , the bar area was filled , restaurant portion wasnt .
0 but that was n't the end of it .

0 the staff is slow and the orders are rarely correct .
0 they post hours til _num_ am on weekends but are rarely open past _num_ .
0 just go further down east wash if you need a crappy taco fix .

0 i assume somebody got there late .
0 understaffed , slow , and disorganized .
0 there is another taco bell down east washington .

0 the food was bland .
0 the beer selection was very poor .

0 i 'll make that drive next time i need my lobster fix .
0 _num_ star for the salty biscuits is a 1/2 star too much .

0 mind you , it was 4:30 p.m. on a monday .
0 i asked what time they close tomorrow , he said , `` 8:30 '' .
0 `` no , we 've got to go . ''

0 she made me feel rushed and took away from the moment .
0 unfortunately , it did n't fit properly .
0 she 's the professional that was hired because she said she could do it .
0 the end result , the dress was too tight .
0 never will i go there again , or would i recommend her services !
0 stopped in because i was nearby and did a search for close coffee shops .

0 unbelievably bad service and only a weak apology are n't going to cut it .
0 my friend had the zucchini potatoes pancakes which were incredible .
0 every time i go there it 's just so mediocre .
0 i do n't know what anyone likes about this place .
0 that 's not what i want to pay for .
0 what really went wrong was when i ordered the vegan sweet potato hash .
0 she took the plate away but offered no real apology for the mistake .
0 however she still charged me for my coffee ... .
0 wow , _num_ stars ?
0 but my room smelled like stale smoke and the desk was really small .
0 front desk was rude and not helpful whatsoever .
0 it 's filthy ... do n't sit on anything .
0 it was nearly empty ... easy to see why .
0 this place is just dirty .
0 for every positive interaction i have , i have two negatives ones .
0 the salesperson said i could pick from any four .
0 nothing happened to it .
0 the lady at the counter was so rude .
0 we did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system .
0 but she needed a person from paint to approve it .
0 no one asked us anything .
0 the garden department is rather large as is my list .
0 hey , i get it .
0 stopped in here after breakfast at denny 's next door .
0 walked through the store to the service desk .
0 as everyone in madison knows , there are no doughnut chain stores around .
0 yelp and the restaurant itself states that this establishment is open until _num_ pm .
0 lights were out , nobody home .
0 i ordered the spinach with rice dish , and my husband got the gyro .
0 i could n't even stomach a few bites .
0 the gyro was a gyro , nothing great , nothing terrible .
0 very bland & the crust ... just no .
0 the teenagers even thought it was mediocre .
0 i have a coupon for free _num_ inch pizza when purchasing _num_ inch pizza .
0 boo shame on them .
0 i ordered a stuffed ( pie ) pizza for carryout .
0 while having a slice i found out that it was not even cooked completely .
0 at that point they lost me and it only got worse .
0 i know for a fact that this was not true .
0 he was even rude with his staff while we were there .
0 very messy and started to come off very quickly .
0 poor hours , selection and service .
0 just there 's not a lot of variety or selection .
0 i swear i 've never left this place not feeling awful .
0 the place reeked of old urine .
0 they would n't even refund our money for the fish we had bought .
0 she never gave advice as to why or what else can be done .
0 i would n't even put a star .
0 maybe they should teach their employees what they r talking about !
0 no way am i going back to them !
0 do the employee 's working here know how to stock the shelves ?
0 not everyone has a _num_ lb dog .
0 i 'm not even asking much .
0 however , the kitty was asleep so we were unable to see her personality .
0 , then told i could chose from the board .
0 but this has been my experience .
0 also , the food was a big disappointment .
0 ever since caf royale took over the scene , the coffee is not fantastic .
0 i do n't come here anymore - bad vibes .
0 friend said that it is not her experience ... maybe a bad make .
0 we have had a terrible customer service experience with this place .
0 unless , you want to have terrible service and regret about your money .
0 can not believe it !
0 this place is horrible for service .
0 another week went by and we heard nothing .
0 we finally talked to him and he said there was no gas leak .
0 the motor had a leak and was covered under warranty .
0 look at all the bad reviews for this place .
0 i looked around and my boat was nowhere to be found .
0 i 've been sitting here for and hour and a half now and nothing .
0 absolute worst dry cleaners in madison .
0 i have had to return multiple shirts because they were not cleaned properly .
0 the new ownership has completely ruined that experience .
0 they have destroyed multiple shirts and the service is poor .
0 the new management is awful .
0 the turn around time is brutal and the customer service is even worse .
0 i would not recommend .
0 full of gristle , did n't taste good , etc .
0 when i complained to the owner , there was never a response .
0 aside from the johnny d 's the others all serve incredibly bad food .

0 im still not sure i 'll go back .
0 i recently had my engagement pictures here .
0 ok still , we can hurry .
0 my fianc did not bc he did not feel comfortable .
0 and my photographer stayed to take pics with my ring .
0 i 've never been treated so terribly .
0 part of me really never wants to go back there ever again .
0 she needs a crash course on customer service .
0 bc she has zero .
0 she basically told us , `` no , '' _num_ different ways .
0 you end up with a slide off mess .
0 grease running down my hand .
0 sorry , pizza pit staff .
0 [ cue the tim & eric `` ya blew it ! ''
0 that was n't much better .
0 all in all , i will never return for a fish fry there .
0 i was utterly wrong .
0 i thought my cod was adequate but rather tasteless and in need at salt .
0 it tasted fishy and disgusting !
0 but , i 'll never be eating here again .
0 this place has really gone downhill .
0 fish fry was over cooked and greasy .
0 i really do n't see any greatness there .
0 have not had lunch or dinner here .
0 my wife and ate there tonight .
0 wish i was told they did have lake perch .
0 after dinner drinks at the bar did n't go so well .
0 took forever to get seated , took even longer to get waited on .
0 the table was not completely cleared nor reset when we were seated .
0 the fish was n't much better , definitely not what we had hoped for .
0 salty , doughy breadsticks .
0 eggplant parmesan , greasy , boring cheese .
0 the red sauce , peppery but no substantial flavor .
0 no , we are n't in italy .
0 i left full , but i can get full at mcdonald 's too .
0 americans do n't know the difference any more .
0 if i could not give any stars i would .
0 she only knew i couldnt do a saturday evening .
0 our main complaint was that it was hot in the restaurant .
0 we were tired and somewhat sad and looking forward to a nice dinner .
0 it did n't start well .
0 he just crowded the plates onto the table while we scrambled to make room .
0 i tasted it , and yup , tasted just like it looked .
0 i guess we 'll skip olive garden next time !
0 the soups were not as good either .
0 i have never had a bad experience with the food here .
0 instead we have _num_ awful ones and three mediocre .
0 i do not recommend this place .
0 they are charging for hot tea and pepper oil .
0 they have better service and half lower price for the better food .
0 i would not eat there again .
0 no fortune in the fortune cookie !
0 second bite into my chicken , and it 's hard .
0 the chicken was bad quality , i 've had much better .
0 prices were n't bad either .
0 i will not go to the restaurant again even in my dreams .
0 prices too high and service very slow .
0 save yourself lots of money and frustration and avoid this location .
0 went here today for a flat tire patch .
0 never again , goodyear !
0 he said they left the most worn tire up front with the new one .
0 do n't count on the people in this store to give you complete information .
0 the staff did not even attempt to address my needs .
0 i wish i could remember this one 's name .
0 i went back the next day and was served by rebecca .
0 she was unfriendly and never smiled !
0 i was very disappointed at the service i got here .
0 my iphone is _num_ 1/2 years old and was turning off on me constantly .
0 i did n't drop it and never had problems before .
0 the worst cell phone experience of my life .
0 the sound was terrible and i spent more time outside than in .
0 mr. roberts has going for it .
0 drinks are reasonably priced too .
0 i got the pathetic haircut ever .
0 i felt so embarrassed .
0 most awful and horrible place to get a haircut .
0 i needed a quick haircut , so was pretty much forced to go here .
0 and this lady was rough .
0 i would not recommend going here .
0 the price is n't even right , at $ _num_ .
0 nobody even bothered to ask me if i was waiting for my appointment .
0 our bill was completely off .
0 however , we only got a refill on the water when the check came .
0 if this is a concern for you , consider a different restaurant .
0 starters were about $ _num_ and entrees were less than $ _num_ .
0 but , i would not come back for dinner .
0 the food was fair to poor , and the dog issue is unappetizing .
0 no longer dog friendly .
0 too bad for them !
0 i live _num_ blocks from the tip top .
0 cash only really sucks .
0 one of the worst kfc 's i have ever eaten at !
0 the potatoes were watery , butter was rock hard .
0 avoid kfc at all costs !
0 the food quality is continuously horrible .
0 when i called and asked to speak to a manager no one spoke english .
0 i ca n't believe this place is still in business .
0 it 's always dead , like a ghost town .
0 i do n't recommend going around the dinner hour for sure .
0 you 've been warned .
0 i was of age but not planning on drinking .
0 extremely slow drink service .
0 each drink took about _num_ minutes to get to the table .
0 and i 'm not twelve .
0 portion was fine for the price , but was the salad ever bland .
0 three tiny croutons on top and flavorless cheese .
0 i wo n't be going back .
0 the sides were not good at all .
0 drinks way over priced !
0 it was shady business .
0 there was a better way to express their concerns , if they were legitimate .
0 turns out they would have charged me less for my breaks .
0 ( that almost never happens ) just be careful and shop around .
0 where was the call before i dropped of as promised !
0 waste of my time .
0 left the car for them to check things out .
0 still i am not going back somewhere that pretty much almost threatened my life .
0 customer service is second to none .
0 yes this place is highly recommended for those looking for crap dentistry .
0 my consultant was ok , but not overly helpful .
0 and there has n't been much info .
0 still no idea when these blinds will arrive .
0 after initial order and down payment i never heard back from them .
0 never had any kind of follow up call to see whether we were happy .
0 wo n't recommend and wo n't use them again .
0 ordering over the phone , everything seemed to go well .
0 she refunds me around _num_ bucks in cash to make up for the overcharge .
0 so i come back and begin with the ribs , 1/2 a slab .
0 from the first taste i was not impressed .
0 the fries dipped in the bbq sauce were the best part by far .
0 and i ordered fries and mashed potatoes , neither of which was included .
0 so the other part of my order was completely wrong in every respect .
0 and note , the chicken was not anything to write home about either .
0 was driving by madison and thought we 'd get some bbq .
0 that was it , not even a big chicken breast ?
0 it looked like it was from a grocery store .
0 i waited _num_ minutes .
0 i did n't have anymore time and asked them to check my order .
0 nope , the ticket was lost .
0 i was so hungry and so sad that i could n't get any ribs .
0 but at least i know she put my ticket into the kitchen .
0 unfortunately , i was disappointed .
0 the salad was just bagged romaine lettuce with dressing in a packet .
0 nothing could be farther from the truth !
0 really bad service worst attitude i 've seen .
0 and then again for game _num_ of the world series .
0 here 's what 's not : extremely inconsistent ribs .
0 why ca n't i get them on my dinner ?
0 the service has n't gotten any better here .
0 do n't go here if you do n't want to be threatened by him .
0 did n't want _num_ plates or anything else .
0 the ribs were very dry and the sides were very small .
0 you will not get great value here .
0 we did find parking on a side street , but not real convenient .
0 the friendly service is probably not enough to get us back for another visit .
0 the ribs are over cooked .
0 if you like bbq sauce , then this may be your spot .
0 i 'm still searching for good bbq meat in madison .
0 our order was very simple but the cashier could n't get it right .
0 every customer had a problem with their food or order .
0 giving two stars only because the food was mediocre .
0 this time it was awful .
0 the noodles were a bit dried out but the sauce was super yummy .
0 i 'll try again , but will more than likely dine-in and not drive-thru .
0 overall , this store is disappointing .
0 we have been buying our dog food from here for years .
0 they will no longer have my family 's business .
0 my oldest died so i wanted to buy a kitten there .
0 they act like your stupid and know nothing about cats .
0 i told them i would n't come back and the could care less .
0 having said all this , my opinion of this store changed as of today .
0 i went into their store to get some dog food .
0 the groomer was not friendly at all .
0 she was n't too happy i had to go back to the grooming area .
0 i asked how long as my husband was picking her up .

0 my previous review was for an oil change , which i still stand by .
0 brought it by that morning and explained the brake problem i was experiencing .

0 i just need a quote because i am shopping around .
0 this place is horrible .
0 they ripped me off so bad on an oil change and filter service .
0 the gyro meat was bland ... gyros are not meant to be bland !
0 if you want spinach pie , go to med cafe .
0 we had coffee , the sausage skillet , and the southern benedict .
0 all was edible , but nothing out of the common way .
0 nothing was fresh , all processed or frozen .
0 service was n't the worst , but also not even as good as mediocre .
0 i will not be coming back .
0 they have an acoustics problem here .
0 it 's horribly loud in there , and everything feels rushed and crushed together .
0 clearly i was not the only one with this impression .
0 what i do not expect is to be treated rudely .
0 i later called panera and spoke with the manager dennis .
0 this location needs new management and new employees .
0 staff never in a hurry .
0 nothing special to write about .
0 service just so so , food just ok and wifi horrible .
0 would not return to this one .
0 could n't even wait to get out of the restaurant to write this review .
0 update : finally got the smoothie _num_ minutes after we finished eating .
0 my order was about _num_ mins apart .

0 this purchase has turned in to an unfortunate experience .
0 the survey is time sensitive and we were unable to comment .

0 my car was no completed on time .
0 east side never fixed the problem but they were glad to keep my money .
0 all of the food is greasy , bland , and expensive .
0 i was there on a hot sat in june .
0 should n't the outside order window be opened .
0 if use a credit card you pay _num_ % more .
0 what a rude and disappointing experience .
0 the custard is ok , but nothing special .
0 for all the hype , michael 's is quite a disappointment .
0 it was slow , disorganized , and not very friendly .
0 one of them just disappeared into a back room .
0 served with about _num_ french fries .
0 are you kidding me ?
0 $ _num_ for a milkshake ?
0 not to mention it was not much of a milkshake .
0 it was not very impressive whatsoever .
0 the hot dog was hot and the chili was warm .
0 i like that they have shredded cheese on it , rather than liquid cheese .
0 _num_ - my dining companion got a burger .
0 it tasted ok , but it was a very thing patty .
0 he also ordered cheese curds with it .
0 they were so greasy and lacked any good flavor in the breading .
0 not even worth the price !
0 did n't michael 's used to be good ?
0 to say i 'm disappointed is an understatement .
0 that should have been my first warning .
0 the bacon was okay , but there was n't enough of it .
0 the cheese was some processed crap .
0 the fries were equally frozen pieces of bland , tasteless crap .
0 i hate to make a fuss , so i did n't .
0 unless something changes , i think i 'm done with michael 's .
0 disturbing to say the least .
0 so far this company has been very disappointing .
0 it was supposed to be delivered on tuesday .

0 this is a terrible company .
0 if i could give negative stars i would .
0 this is an illegal and unethical business practice !
0 if i could give negative stars i would .
0 customer service is awful .
0 i 'm not even sure where to begin .
0 that quickly turned into an hour and a half .
0 the staff was really chaotic and unorganized .
0 there was literally almost no fish .
0 literally these are the words we just exchanged after getting home .
0 no , the `` wedge '' was lettuce , carrots and bacon .
0 only gave them one star because zero was n't an option !
0 i had a very unpleasant experience with the owner of this business today .
0 when we got there nobody was there .
0 no phone call , no e-mail , nothing .
0 for tonight , the feast of the dollars is upon us .
0 i asked again , and he had to go get his manager ?
0 the shelves were not stocked and there was stuff everywhere .
0 i was looking for a bath mat , a fan and some groceries .
0 the lighting was dim and very difficult to find what i needed .
0 there were employees walking around but no one was putting things on shelves .
0 the produce department was disgusting - moldy food , smelly .
0 i could n't believe it .
0 i am a frequent walmart shopper .
0 they are completely inefficient , slow , lazy , and rude .
0 she was , just as the previous clerk , extremely slow and uncaring .
0 it took forever to get my stuff and get out of there .
0 however , the layout and design should have probably stayed in the _num_ 's .
0 was sent by one walmart to this walmart for the last of a product .
0 i grab another employee .
0 who spent _num_ minutes in the back searching for the wrong product !
0 this is a ridiculous game of cat and mouse and i 'm really unimpressed .

0 my room is next to the elevator too .
0 i walked in and there was a white lady getting her bike fixed .
0 the guy working there looked past me and serviced the white lady before me !
0 it was clear that i was next , but he did n't serve me .
0 i patiently waiting thinking something was strange .
0 he then asked me what i needed .
0 i explained and we walked to the pump .
0 he just left me standing there .
0 i walked back in the shop wondering what was going on .
0 he thanked me for my patience and went along .
0 ... and he walked back in the store , leaving me by myself .
0 i 'm serious , i stood there shocked and wondering what was happening .
0 i did n't deserve service like this .
0 he did n't need to treat me with such disregard .
0 they do n't deserve your money .
0 stay away and tell your friends to not support this shop .
0 now , it 's all horrible .
0 cheese sticks were under cooked , the pizza was extremely greasy .
0 i mean , oil was literally dripping out of the crust .
0 first time great and reasonably priced for fries , boneless buffalo wings and dips .
0 you 're kind of a disaster sometimes , man .
0 but just ... just get it together , dude .
0 do i need an artisan barbecue glaze on my crust ?
0 be greasy and awful and ridiculous , pizza hut .
0 when he explained his diagnosis he raised his voice at me for no reason .
0 that was enough for me to look elsewhere for auto repair .
0 julie was the consultant who helped me .
0 i then signed and returned with a _num_ % down payment .
0 what a customer service disaster .
0 avoid this place like the plague .
0 clearly this company does n't work well with others .
0 dirty counters , messy machines , and dirty tables .
0 who knew you could mess up a blizzard so bad ?
0 no card , no money left their hand .
0 they are like , it is just brownies .
0 he ordered a turtle pecan blizzard and received some random peanuts in his blizzard .
0 when i asked for one , they said they did not have any .
0 and just walked away .
0 besides the poor service , the food standards were disgusting .
0 they get a negative star !
0 this dq does not even deserve _num_ star .
0 they were out of pie pieces , okay fine .
0 tried it , it was discussing .
0 waste of $ _num_ .
0 by the looks of the other reviews the owner does n't give a crap .

0 neither my dad nor i were impressed with the food .
0 this is not a good thing .
0 not a lot of great variety .
0 i had the 1/2 rack of ribs with slaw and fries .
0 the slaw and fries were fine .
0 nothing special but not bad .
0 the ribs , on the other hand , could use some work .
0 sauce should provide an accent to good bbq , not be the bbq .
0 one rib was fall of bone .
0 further down , it was closer to jerky .
0 all in all , not a great bbq experience .
0 service was flat out terrible .
0 not even close to the best in madison .
0 the ribs were very dry and tough .
0 will not be going back .
0 it used to my favorite place for barbecue .
0 the cook said that happens sometimes and sent out two cold pieces of rib .
0 i tried a chicken leg first and all i could taste was smoke .
0 the breast was dry .
0 next i tried the ribs .
0 they were tender , but for some reason they tasted like sausage .
0 the baked beans were pretty good .
0 the coleslaw is what hurt .
0 bottom line is i 've had better bbq in the madison area .
0 we decided on the tuesday special - all you can eat chicken and ribs .
0 i would not recommend fat jacks .
0 service was 3-4 stars but food was a _num_ stars .
0 however the the fried mushrooms were good .

0 on an early saturday evening , i walked in to an empty restaurant .
0 my quesadilla was a bean taco , yup definitely not a quesadilla .
0 i ordered a burrito with chorizo and it was very bland .

0 food did n't look fresh and was pretty flavorless .
0 the refried beans look like they have an artificial light purple color to them .
0 service was slow and unprofessional .
0 spend your money in a local hardware store .
0 the inside is huge , but arranged poorly .
0 the new checkout lines are set up in a really dumb way .
0 it was an awkward exchange given he did n't say anything .
0 i was probably wrong about the latter part .
0 he told me that 's not how it works .
0 again , this is apparently not how it works .
0 farm and fleet or fleet farm is my only go to now !
0 worst customer service ever !

0 i then waited another _num_ minutes for my drink .
0 this is the 2nd time i 've been disappointed by this site .
0 poor management and training of staff is very evident .
0 one of the worst starbucks i have ever been to .
0 bathrooms messy without toilet paper men 's restroom .

0 big store , lots of seating and staff , filthy .
0 i really hate stores , especially that serve food , that are filthy .
0 at the moment i 'm especially pissed , because they killed my car .
0 the cable never connected well , as if they did n't test it .
0 i called to have the repair , no follow up .
0 ( not cheaper ) .
0 hell no ... they eat mostly meat and some veggies .
0 even if it appears to be absurd , like a sunday paper .
0 i really do n't understand why anyone would go here .
0 it 's all garbage .
0 the only semi good brand is sassy cow and again , guess what ?
0 more than six dollars per container !
0 the bakery section is gross , too .
0 your bakery department sucks big time .
0 you charge ridiculous prices on your desserts that are made just not right .
0 no worries many options to choose from near by .
0 they scream about being local but they really dont partner with local businesses .
0 i just wonder how often this happens .
0 and be sure to check the prices at the register !
0 oh yea they did disgusting !
0 if i had to eat that meat i would rather stare to death !
0 not only that , but the store is over-priced and not well laid out .

0 _num_ ) the portions are small on every sandwich that we ordered .
0 _num_ ) they say they do n't have any monthly deals .
0 _num_ ) tried it twice and both times they messed up our order .
0 this place is pretty gross .
0 have some standards , arby 's .
0 however , it took _num_ minutes to get our food .
0 _num_ minutes we sat there and waited .
0 i know that french fries are not usually made in individual orders .
0 visited for the first time on friday , july _num_ .
0 wow , what a disappointment .
0 steak sandwiches are supposed to be lean !
0 i was n't expecting philly quality , but this was gross .
0 bad service and unfriendly staff .
0 everyone looks like working there has made them bitter , fat and angry .
0 the food is not good ; never order the fries !
0 the crowd there is so-so at best , usually on the trashy side .
0 we refuse to spend our money at an establishment like this .
0 its no wonder the parking lot was pretty much empty !
0 i was excited to work with carl at my tasting .
0 i had some issues finding the place and traffic was bad .
0 i called a few days later to reschedule and left a message .
0 several days passed with no response .
0 i was left feeling he was very stuck up and unprofessional .
0 what a waste of time .
0 fake rum , maybe ?
0 i really think people buy these cakes because they do n't know any better .
0 carl also is very stuck in his ways when it comes to design .
0 the kitchen room itself smelled like butter with the cake sitting in the room .
0 it was totally disgusting .
0 so carl , just a word of advice .
0 it 's okay , i guess .
0 lousy grocery and produce , but excellent doughnuts .
0 they have minimal selection and the prices are nothing to get excited about .
0 therefore , i end up there for groceries more often than not .
0 i have tried a few places with no luck .
0 so rather than waste gas money , i began calling around .
0 the phone was answered and i simply asked : do you carry time magazine ?
0 if she was busy she could have said that .
0 she says she does not know .
0 that is my whole experience trying to find a magazine .
0 i walked out feeling completely terrible .
0 i will not go to your store .
0 however , do not get your nails done here .
0 its decor is horrible .
0 it 's pricing itself out of madison .
0 this is not a great first impression .
0 this place as reopened and should have stayed closed .
0 literally the worst hair experience of my entire life .
0 the other _num_ stations were dusty .
0 no one or nothing was in the manicure area .
0 it looked like a ghost town .
0 the entire experience was uncomfortable .
0 that 's not what i 'm paying $ _num_ for .
0 they gave me a discount price of $ _num_ .
0 i did n't realize the place shut down .
0 the ultimate now is not the ultimate it was years ago .
0 it 's horrible and i strongly advise against going there .
0 extremely disappointing first time visit .
0 thank you for wasting my time today .
0 at $ _num_ it was definitely not a good value .
0 this place is for lack of a better word , simply the worst !
0 i ordered the fish basket , which for wisconsin should never be bad .
0 i was very wrong !
0 okay , then let me do it now : the food was cold !
0 i would never go to this place again .
0 they were not exciting .
0 i do n't see myself ever wanting to come back for dinner .
0 when we got our drinks , they were weak !
0 that waitress needs _num_ things : some training and an order pad .
0 awful service , rude bartenders .
0 i tip well but yeah ... they might get a penny .
0 he was not at all apologetic .
0 this is terrible customer service .
0 i am looking elsewhere .
0 i do n't know where their beef is from .
0 they really deserve a _num_ so i rounded down .
0 the owner responded to my request with a simple `` no . ''
0 not a true butcher either .
0 this kfc never has the chicken you want ready .
0 the staff and customers are awful .
0 this place can not ever give me everything i order .
0 the service was slow .
0 when i got home , the food was poor quality .
0 the mashed potatoes were dry and the macaroni and cheese was lumpy .
0 even the coleslaw was very dry .
0 some of the staff barely knows english past the menu items and prices .
0 i really wish i had read the reviews before i came here .
0 a chain restaurant i thought ; how bad could it be ... ?
0 unfortunately , there was a big language barrier .
0 what bothered me was a listed dish at $ _num_ was $ _num_ !
0 potato wedges : awful .
0 this particular bucks seems to be hit or miss .
0 the crust is incredibly thin .
0 their sizes are not generously portioned out .
0 i want to like them more , but they are just sub-par .
0 nothing stood out to me .
0 i appreciated that they put the pizza in the paper bags .
0 unfortunately , i will not be back again .
0 not understanding the good reviews here .
0 their pizza is gross .
0 with so many choices , i simply ca n't consider this one again .
0 thought it was dirty and did n't find the food very good at all .
0 after that though , i was n't very impressed .
0 curry was bland and lacked spice and punch .
0 ca n't really mess up the rice so no complaints .
0 plantains were a little soggy and lacked crisp .
0 food was ok , place was dingy , and the staff was very rude .
0 avoid i would give zero stars if i could .
0 uninspired chinese food from very nice people .
0 maybe that 's why i only had three bites .
0 quoted _num_ minutes , was here in _num_ .
0 the lo mien was also horrible .
0 there saving grace is their hot sour soup .
0 but in all honestly , nothing special .
0 this is not the place i recommend .
0 normally i think crappy chinese food is good .
0 still eating , but this is really disappointing so i 'm typing this now .
0 the general tso 's is terrible like the others say .
0 there 's just no flavor .
0 the shrimp is n't very good , but not as bad as the chicken .
0 the crab rangoon is terrible .
0 hell , asian kitchen is better than this place .
0 they told me that would be _num_ each .
0 i wo n't be ordering again .
0 how about you do n't nickel and dime your customers .
0 i 'm not _num_ percent sure .
0 i 've been down south and had amazing sausage gravy .
0 if i want that crap , i 'll stay home and cook it myself .
0 i 'm not going back .
0 bad service and even worse `` food . ''
0 they get _num_ star because of all the adorable old people there .
0 i get it , it is small , simple , nothing special .
0 however , the place is not awful .
0 it is just your local breakfast place with food options under $ _num_ .
0 it was a plain ham and cheese omelette .
0 this restaurant reminds me of cute little hole in the wall breakfast places .
0 unfortunately , it just can not compete with some of its neighboring restaurants .
0 the diner was n't particularly busy , but it was n't empty either .
0 while not at all healthy , i knew it was a pretty safe bet .
0 my husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger and i had the veggie benedict .
0 rotten tomatoes ruin your taste for anything .
0 it 's pretty hard to make a bad chocolate chip pancake .
0 also the coffee was not good .
0 we were , to say the least very disappointed .
0 otherwise a complete waste of our money .
0 or previous experiences had is enjoying this establishment , but not this time .
0 we were disappointed , good chance we will not be returning .
0 poor selection , poor lighting , bad layout and overpriced .
0 late night madison is tough when you are hungry .
0 dining room is a little dingy for a chain .
0 hamburgers , fries , soda and of course a frosty .
0 likely the hamburger gave me food poisoning friday night .
0 my husband and son were ok , and they had nearly identical meals .
0 everything that is wrong with chain restaurants .
0 unlimited fries with every sandwich ?
0 really bland tasting food , and annoying atmosphere , as well as annoying staff .
0 the food has nothing unique about it .
0 quite uncomfortable , but the only seating available .
0 it was an experience that i will never forget .
0 i will be in no hurry to go back .
0 poor service , noisy , but pretty good food .
0 dude knew one thing , which was that he had not made a mistake .
0 upon further review , management is not getting the proper training .
0 it is not ok to treat a customer like that guy treated me .
0 could n't believe how long it took to be served below mediocre food .
0 we were seated promptly and our drink order was taken .
0 our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup .
0 the fries were cold on all our meals .
0 at that point i was disgusted - and done .
0 someone by the name of justin apologized , who was he ?
0 they could have put them back on our card 's .
0 extremely rude ended up leaving before we could even order .
0 but my low point is for the service .
0 we wait during _num_ minutes or more and never receive any waitress .
0 not our first visit , not our first choice .
0 extremely overpriced , underwhelming food .
0 $ _num_ for a meh burger ?
0 if i could have given today 's experience negative stars , i would have .
0 nothing beyond what you can get anywhere else in this city .
0 this is what took red robin straight into the toilet .
0 from the moment we walked in , this place felt different .
0 she did n't even bother checking on our drink situations in the meantime .
0 just went all ghost and ignored us .
0 at no point does the manager come by to check on us .
0 not many customers at the time .
0 sat waiting _num_ minutes for a server to bring us menus .
0 there were _num_ or _num_ servers standing around chatting with each other .
0 was told a _num_ minute wait that turned into _num_ .
0 poor timing of food service .
0 bad experience , red robin !
0 anyway , the rating is for the food .
0 but after our most recent visit , i 'm not feeling the love .
0 we did n't receive any fries until they brought our order .
0 when she brought the bills , there was no discount .
0 i was very disappointed with the entire visit .
0 if your looking for quality customer service this is not the place to go .
0 food was not the greatest and the service was extremely slow .
0 there were no chunks of potato or clams .
0 the replacement was not the greatest in taste .
0 i really was hoping for good food not money off of our order .
0 service : terrible - overly helpful , yet completely unhelpful .
0 i 've made better wine .
0 in the end , they were shitty wines , and it a shitty experience .
0 which is too bad , because i was really looking for something nice .
0 horrible service , old flowers .
0 perhaps good product , but really poor service .
0 the only way its worth the money is going all day .
0 multiple people acted really rude .
0 she also stated everything was in stock .
0 the sales guy went down to get everything and i waited an hour .
0 finally he comes back and again it 's not going to work .
0 i could not believe it .
0 i had asked for the manager to call me and he did n't .
0 he did not care .
0 the next day , i was sick all day .
0 you will be very sorry that you did !
0 do you like greasy overcooked american chinese ?
0 dragon & phoenix , eh pretty bad .
0 i went to lunch here once and then never again .
0 my advice , avoid this place at all costs .
0 your hard earned money is better spent at a different chinese take-out restaurant .
0 i used to eat here all the time but they 've lost my business .
0 the guy i talked to was completely rude they lost my business forever .
0 bad service average chinese food .
0 went to noodles for lunch on a saturday , place was not busy .
0 plates and bowls ( all of them ) were chipped .
0 for some reason it just was not hitting the spot with me .
0 frankly it was nowhere to be found .
0 additionally , my japanese pan noodle bowl left much to be desired .
0 while i like noodles & company in general , this location is lacking .
0 that makes them a fast food outlet , no more .
0 order was taken right away and served promptly .
0 there were people at one other table and i believe _num_ people on staff .
0 also , the prices are too high .
0 these guys rip you off .
0 i went in to the urgent care as i was having severe ear pain .
0 i was very insulted .
0 i even tried a salad in an attempt to find something healthy .
0 i 'll keep trying , though .
0 it has a vanilla custard base with waffle cones and chocolate pieces in it .
0 first , there was not many piece of chocolate or waffle cone in it .
0 i like their vanilla ice cream , this flavor did nothing for it .
0 i should have just gotten vanilla and skipped the frustration .
0 the blueberries are really hard and frozen .
0 it was hard to enjoy because the blueberries were so hard .
0 i really like the donut , the pie , just everything .
0 it was too sweet and did not have a good cream flavor .
0 making cream flavored ice cream and adding chocolate does not make it boston cream .
0 the effort was there but the execution was sad .
0 i wish i had taken pictures of my visit today .
0 a _num_ year old electric stove ( $ _num_ ) .
0 an antique dresser with missing handles ( $ _num_ ) .
0 there goes $ _num_ .
0 of course the unit has an error code _num_ months later .
0 pretty disgusted with the service and the way i was treated .
0 although they may sell a good product , they are way overpriced .
0 shop around , they are really money hungry .
0 customer service was pitiful .
0 friday fish fry was awful .
0 my boyfriends fish was also disappointing .
0 our party was seated _num_ minutes after ordering .
0 my bland plate of fish was n't something i 'll come back for .
0 i 'm just too use to food with seasoning on it .
0 after three attempts , we finally rode out the wait for the fish fry .
0 that seems to be the draw of this dumpy little joint .
0 the restaurant equivalent of flying coach .
0 it was not good .
0 walked in on a busy fish fry night for the first time .
0 the bar was two people deep so that was nearly impossible .
0 we put in our order for _num_ entrees and an appetizer .
0 it was about _num_ minutes before we were finally seated .
0 the hashbrowns with cheese were pretty bland and nothing to write home about .
0 was really excited to try their fish fry after hearing many raves .
0 i have too much to lose .
0 so i get the bartender and explain the story .
0 she does nothing but tell him to apologize .
0 so he sticks his hand out and says sorry .
0 come to find out the owner was the male bartender .
0 1st time and as i say one and done .
0 this place was an ass backwards train wreck .
0 the steak was full of gristle and had no flavor .
0 me no never will i stop again .
0 yeah , long story short ... .
0 the food sucked ass .
0 my lobster was obviously frozen burned and way way way over cooked .
0 the lady at the front desk tells me i 'll owe $ _num_ .
0 the little asian dentist comes in and once again ( surprise ! )
0 so i saved $ _num_ just by not going to door creek .
0 this is a harsh review but these things matter .
0 do not allow your dogs to go to daycare here .
0 no accommodations were offered .
0 i would n't recommend this hotel to anyone !
0 this place is beyond terrible !
0 but stupid expensive drinks and the bartenders do not give very good service .
0 and only then if there is nothing else going on .
0 this place is awful .
0 no hot single chicks here .
0 slow service for both the drinks and our food .
0 waitress never checked to see if i wanted another drink .
0 places like this should be using mystery shoppers to test and improve their service .
0 it was not good .
0 it was not bad .
0 cole slaw was horrible in a little cup .
0 when we were half done eating she tried to clear our plates .
0 i really have no desire to return ever again .
0 the others are n't so great .
0 and it was indeed mediocre .
0 my chicken sandwich was pretty basic california chicken .
0 it came smothered in some sort of spread .
0 my sandwich felt apart immediately .
0 i did n't get sick from eating it , so that 's a plus .
0 so the three of us all ate mediocre chicken sandwiches and we survived .
0 people seem to like their pizza , so maybe go with that .
0 the worst place to watch sports in madison !
0 waited over _num_ 1/2 hours to receive our apps .
0 looked like a party on a budget .
0 was n't much blue cheese in it .
0 my girlfriend immediately felt sick and only ate one piece .
0 weak tap beer line up .
0 the only plus , not many people showed up and good sound .
0 ignored it for the movie while they continued being loud and rude throughout .
0 they did n't even go in and check .
0 horrible excuse for theater staff and keeping the bs out .
0 when the occasion calls for it i upgrade to a purse .
0 but this time it created a problem .
0 but you see i was wrong about what they were looking for .
0 i was not the only one standing there .
0 another patron complimented me on the points i made to tom , the manager .
0 the box office person did not even realize that a time was cancelled .
0 everything else started during the _num_ o'clock hour .
0 it was offensive to be suggested that i see some other movie .
0 tonight , they lost at least ten patrons ( that i could see ) .
0 ca n't come in at all with it ?
0 expensive for food that is mediocre .
0 it 's just bad .
0 horrible , horrible service .
0 the second time , they lost me as a customer .
0 the food was okay , nothing special .
0 if i could give them zero stars , i would .
0 i went there once and had a horrible waitress .
0 i ordered a small deep dish pizza and it was dripping in grease .
0 i do n't suggest going to this place at all .
0 i do n't suggest coming here for a good time .
0 i eventually just gave up trying to call them .
0 the restaurant was not busy at all .
0 walked in and had to wait for the hostess .
0 the manager came to apologize , offered us a free dessert .
0 oh yea , then we had to wait for the check !
0 needless to say , we took our business elsewhere .
0 i am disappointed to say the least .
0 too many other fine restaurants in madison to give this one another try .
0 under new ownership , the place is now called metro ford of madison .
0 beyond the cheesy exterior , he was nice .
0 here 's where i 'm not happy .
0 after leaving the business office my salesman takes me over to my new ride .
0 so i wait an hour for the truck to be cleaned properly .
0 i want to know how to operate the towing package .
0 i do n't want to take a call from god knows who !
0 lousy service once they have your money .
0 i gave them _num_ full business days to fix my car .
0 i called my insurance company to let them know they are bad for business !
0 they do n't even deserve a _num_ star !
0 they cheated me almost _num_ thousand dollar which is very huge amount for me .
0 i was cheated around _num_ $ .
0 please be very careful if you still want to visit this showroom .
0 i would never do business with anyone at this firm again .
0 it was hit or miss and its been hot !
0 he was in a hurry to get out too .
0 it cost me 1/4 of what i paid all comfort for nothing !
0 i stopped in without a reservation and luckily they had a room .
0 not ultra modern , but contemporary design .
0 the fault of courtyard ?
0 however , what happened that night , i could n't sleep through .
0 so not entirely their fault , but still was a very bad experience .
0 i love dogs and feel bad for all of them that are in there .
0 that being said , i think that they would be better off elsewhere .
0 i have lived in other places and no one runs a shelter like this .
0 i was like this makes no sense she is a wheelchair .
0 dog rooms not so bad .
0 this place was a huge disappointment .
0 the place was overpriced and left me with a not so fresh feeling .
0 we ordered the food over the phone and it was ready in _num_ minutes .
0 negatives : it is not cheap .
0 there was not very much included with our dinner .
0 i was really disappointed and felt a little cheated .
0 but the woman who runs the restaurant with her husband blew my mind .
0 `` hmm ... cheap .
0 at this point i shrugged and took out some cash .
0 then she just stared at me .
0 i realized she wanted me to give her money for having my card declined .
0 but she could n't tell me , because she did n't know .
0 the fees are reasonable and customers generally like using it .
0 i 'm a big fan of sushi and was not impressed by anything here .
0 the seaweed salad was fine and the hot sake was average .
0 the rolls left for more to be desired .
0 i left feeling hungry and disappointed .
0 i was very disappointed .
0 what a lazy job they were doing in there .
0 but i wish the sandwiches were a little bigger .
0 i guess i 'll try the french bread next time .
0 miller 's is n't bad -- but it 's nothing special either .
0 want a room with scary stains and torn carpeting ?
0 the breakfast buffet was pretty weak .
0 the room was fine but nothing fancy .
0 the _num_ people at the front desk ignored us when we first came in .
0 i was left feeling confused .
0 he has never had a problem like this .
0 we will not be staying there again .
0 this easily ranks among the worst .
0 after getting into the room i was n't much happier .
0 this not a three and a half star place .
0 staff are not nice .
0 crazy loud noise at _num_ am was ignored by staff .
0 unfortunately , the entire city of madison moves on the same day .
0 so , we had no other place to stay .
0 if you have a choice , i would not recommend this place .
0 -they only spent _num_ minutes on my car and it shows .
0 no appt possible for detailing on weekends !
0 could the rumors be true that they protect certain clientele from bad reviews ?
0 overall it was a terrible car wash .
0 they seem to loose sight of what it means to detail a car .
0 they wiped my interior with a wet cloth , end of story .
0 worse place to get your car washed .
0 they talked more than detailing .
0 while the rest of the world gets a skinny sandwich and crap service .
0 i suggest going down the road to university station and hit the subway there .
0 someone please teach the employees here how to better scrub the toilets .
0 i almost lost my appetite after using the women 's restroom .
0 when i want to drink at a dive i want the lights dim .
0 the bartender was nice but the place was empty .
0 it is wrong , and i was wrong for eating it .
0 few times in my life have i been so wrong .
0 the workmanship was alright but the customer service was mediocre at best .
0 it took many visits to ensure the job was done correctly .
0 i would recommend you look elsewhere for better service .
0 this place is awful .
0 we both received terrible service .
0 and its only _num_ dollars .
0 do not come here , you will be greatly disappointed .
0 overpriced and poor quality .
0 totally disrespectful and horrible job !
0 stopped in for relaxing mani before my trip and walk out posting this !
0 that said , my concerns with them were on going from the get go .
0 crusty on the outside , yet dense and soft on the inside .
0 i would have happily given you five stars just for your plain bagel .
0 they had the consistency of cardboard and no flavor .
0 i would never order from this location again , they are very slow .
0 the pizza had no feta cheese at all .
0 ... no more domino 's for me .
0 i spent $ _num_ for my nails to last _num_ days !
0 what kind of business does n't stand behind their work .
0 when she did , she ordered me to wash my hands .
0 i would return only if i could guarantee an appointment with the adult employees .
0 i was treated horribly !
0 the lady used old acrylic and it made my nails yellow !
0 she was rude and i will never go here again !
0 on two separate occasions , i stumbled upon really expired food .
0 since i have been only to _num_ so far this is on average ground .
0 there is a discount _num_ dollar bin as well .
0 you can also select online coupons to load to your card from the website .
0 i do n't see how they failed to miss a burned out part .
0 they really are n't out to impress , only to fill your belly .
0 i kind of wish that the menu would be more clear .
0 this is the worst bbq resturant i 've ever are at .
0 i ca n't believe i 'm writing this .
0 tonight was an epic fail on customer service .
0 when it was our turn he handed phone to the person .
0 it was partially wrong so i corrected and she said ok and hung up .
0 when the food arrived it was totally wrong .
0 i would describe this place as mediocre at best .
0 i wish there was a way to give zero stars .
0 my first ( and only time there ) was a horrible experience .
0 only thing left was the meat .
0 sad , sad , sad experience .
0 coleslaw : shredded cabbage with straight vinegar on it .
0 i 'm pretty sure there were no other ingredient .
0 mac & cheese : disgusting .
0 black dog is minutes away but did n't want to bother .
0 that was a huge mistake .
0 but was n't a big fan of the sides .
0 price was not counted correctly .
0 come to find out he was a manager .
0 i was not impressed at all !
0 what pork i tasted that was n't smothered in beans was n't too bad .
0 not a place i will re visit .
0 they do n't watch the expiration dates on many products , so always check .
0 the aisles are too small .
0 never been out of there under _num_ minutes after 5pm .
0 so if you have a choice do not come to this post office .
0 no help at all .
0 not that hard to deliver mail .
0 i would give them _num_ stars if possible .
0 courteous service can only go so far .
0 i went to take some dry cleaning here and was disappointed .
0 the last time i ate there was the last time .
0 skip it and go to sam 's cafe .
0 so someone my girlfriend knew said that this was the place to try .
0 after the drive we were starving so we needed food .
0 had chicken and noodles my noodles where not done at all .
0 the place looked clean , service i had better too .
0 i guess twice was enough for me .
0 we had the beef steak , fried chicken , and ham and beans .
0 even the apple dumplings were just okay .
0 the bedding had burn holes from cigarettes and also had the awesome cigarette smell .
0 do n't stay here there are better places in urbana .
0 i would never stay here again .
0 the room itself was very basic , which i expected and did not mind .
0 very thin walls increased the noise .
0 we requested new sheets for _num_ rooms because of blood and other stains .
0 all were very dirty with stains from floor to ceiling .
0 only stay here if you are _num_ .
0 the place is dirty dirty dirty .
0 the carpet in the hallway is very dirty .
0 so i have made them a lot of money staying there .
0 but the blankets are nasty full of burn marks .
0 kenny the manager is very inconsiderate and not reasonable .
0 the hallway floors were nasty & so was the room .
0 very very very dirty , maybe a local party motel for the university nearby .
0 the coffee is bad .
0 also , the coffee only comes in small cups .
0 jar of rocket fuel , but settled for _num_ oz .
0 i think steak 'n shake is just not my style .
0 every other part of the meal was a disaster .
0 my burger was missing everything but meat and cheese .
0 this place is sad .
0 never washing his hands and never wearing gloves .
0 this place is a total joke !
0 save your hard earned money and avoid this steak 'n shake at all cost .
0 server was good but the kitchen sucked .
0 _num_ min for a chicken melt and a chilli mac .
0 the waitress was rude .
0 kept looking down at us and service was slow .
0 this is a horrible steak and shake !
0 the floor is dirty and sticky and my food was cold .
0 i ordered the eggplant chicken special .
0 i was very excited after recently having some excellent garlic eggplant from green jade .
0 as it turns out , i celebrated a bit too soon .
0 the eggplant was n't thoroughly cooked , making it sort of bitter and tough .
0 also , they did n't use chinese eggplant , which was sort of confusing .
0 it was american ( globe ) eggplant .
0 that dish was not spicy in the least .
0 they were stale and not very good .
0 still , i do n't think i 'll be back .
0 i went there again today , ordered the szechuan chicken and was very dissapointed .
0 never gives total over the phone .
0 they hire kids that do n't care much about the customers .

0 nothing seems to stay there for long .
0 this is one place that really needs to go away !
0 lately the sides have been awful .
0 the okra and casserole were cold .

0 no big deal there .
0 with two steaks sent back , i 'm not exactly getting the royal treatment .
0 my coke was empty .
0 i think this breaks a record for me .

0 the steak was kinda ... meh ... not great nor bad .
0 there was n't a good steak flavor as i 'd expect from a restaurant .
0 the baked potato was delivered piping hot .

0 i could n't believe what i was hearing .
0 wo n't make this mistake again .

0 within a month they have messed up _num_ of our pizzas .
0 our waitress was rude and did t want to fix the issue .

0 the pizza was barely warmer than room temperature .
0 i 'm really not sure how this place has gotten such high ratings .
0 the complementary breakfast is not good .
0 i 've been staying here over a month due to my job .
0 this has been over a month of getting breakfast .
0 no luck with calling for any help in complaint .
0 ownership does n't seem to care .
0 will go elsewhere next time .
0 are you freakin ' kidding me ?
0 you wo n't be doing it this sunday .
0 so one afternoon , stopped by to eat a chicken teriyaki sandwich .

0 overpriced and never again especially for female haircuts .
0 she told me no .
0 _num_ classes are where learning goes to die .

0 i ca n't believe there are so many positive reviews of this place .
0 never ordering from this place again .
0 but i was n't in the mood for meat .
0 bland , boring , and worst of all , super greasy .
0 now that 's what i call mediocre !
0 i 'm not a snob when it comes to chinese food at all .
0 cons : decor was sort of confusing and borderline gross .
0 the biggest con , however ?
0 the egg roll was disappointing .
0 it used to be good .
0 but today the barista made me so mad !
0 it 's like a sunday evening and there 's seriously no one here .
0 it 's not like i took a long time deciding what i wanted .
0 really , the worst of the espresso locations on campus .
0 the coffee here is atrocious .
0 cup of flavorless grey water .
0 third strike , you 're out !
0 i 've given this place three opportunities to _num_ .
0 starbucks became starbucks for a reason .
0 i do n't know what to say .
0 it 's just milk , dude .
0 the drinks , like everything else there , are overpriced for their quality .
0 this place is as expensive as starbucks coffee .
0 the only difference is at espresso royal , you get a lower quality cup .
0 with the starbucks right down the street it is not worth going here .
0 the only day worth visiting is on wednesday because they have one dollar lattes .
0 rob you blind at every turn .
0 not at all from my experience .
0 _num_ ) i lost my keys to my apartment .

0 they do not clean their own furniture and floor .
0 this is very strange for me .

0 not a lot of nail salons open on sunday here .
0 the entire salon and nail stations were disgusting .
0 there was a layer of acrylic dust on everything .
0 the place was terrible .
0 however , i was able to find a few suits to try on .
0 she did but her parents did nothing and said nothing .
0 i only went in to grab a shirt very quickly .
0 it 's a piece of junk .
0 the only thing you can use this worthless coupon on is their junk .
0 the bulbs are n't hot , and the customer service was poor .
0 it was not worth fighting campus traffic to get there .
0 we rented a truck online and had our confirmation email and receipt with us .
0 needless to say , this business ranks among the most poorly run in town .
0 i ordered a _num_ ' truck with no extras for my move .
0 this place is awful !
0 the employees are either dumb or just do n't give a shit .
0 they 're unorganized and totally clueless .
0 i have never used a business so poorly run .
0 or maybe they 're all this bad .
0 also , the boxes that i bought there fell apart .
0 this location is weird .
0 their customer service is terrible .
0 this place needs at least two more employees , and better customer service .
0 it 's fine but such a hassle for a $ _num_ rental .

0 he made no effort to reach a resolution .
0 other locations do much better than this one , it 's a shame really .
0 did n't even get to try it .
0 that 's not what i got .
0 my time was absolutely wasted .
0 one of your few redeeming qualities is that you have bass on tap .
0 the only good time to go is when it 's nearly empty .
0 i do n't get why people go here just for the wings .
0 i 've had bad times at brothers .
0 it gets too crowded to play darts .
0 guard your jacket unless you want a free drink spilled on it .
0 it seems to be totally random .
0 never wasting my time at brother 's again .
0 my ears hurt more than anywhere else i 've been .
0 _num_ ) never enough space .
0 _num_ ) hot as hell .
0 you 'll be sweating just standing there even in the middle of winter .
0 the fans on the ceiling are useless .
0 more like a sports bar and super crowded and not really relaxing .
0 have no place to stand or sit .
0 also , the dj 's are inept .
0 the buzz - only reason this is getting _num_ stars .
0 i would avoid this company at all costs !
0 please avoid this company at all costs .
0 on top of that these people are condescending assholes .
0 do not use these people , they are terrible .
0 i was disappointed with crispy tofu that is not as good as before .
0 my boyfriend was a little annoyed since he had gotten something completely different .
0 it was very salty and unpleasant .
0 i felt disgusted that i actually ate half since i was so hungry .
0 _num_ ) a combination of number _num_ and _num_ .
0 never again stay away from this place !
0 i 've never experienced this type of service before - or lack there of .
0 there was n't a lot of options , only about _num_ items .
0 both of which were disappointing !
0 the shrimp crepe only had two small pieces of shrimp .
0 around $ _num_ to share _num_ dishes .
0 but now it 's barely passable .
0 their fried rice is all gummy and their noodle soups are too salty .
0 it was a very disappointing .
0 in my opinion , that is way too long for an hour lunch break .
0 we walked in and it was very hectic .
0 _num_ minutes had gone by and nothing .
0 about _num_ minutes later , our first dish came out .
0 slowly , our little dim sum dishes came out .
0 however , my last two visits were terrible .
0 they simply served it .
0 the first time i was not sure .
0 i ca n't imagine why this would happen .
0 i ordered the hot pot and it was n't even a hot pot .
0 there was no soup ( wtf ) !
0 the food is oily and lacks flavor .
0 overall , i feel like i really wasted my money here .
0 i would give zero star if i could .
0 this place is a total rip off .
0 the owner explained that the sweet soy sauce was an extra $ _num_ .
0 had i not asked she would never had told me .
0 i said belly , and a magical one dollar was added to my bill .
0 then i specially asked whether the rick comes with dishes or not .
0 at this point , i was beyond pissed by this dishonest act .
0 hell i will never ever return to this restaurant .
0 this is a horrible place .
0 even after they have already known you are healthy .
0 she is so bad that i get anxiety talking to her .
0 she makes mistakes , she shows her ego , and she does not care .
0 they do n't know how to bill correctly !
0 another issue i had is for another annual exam .
0 better yet , just find a different healthcare facility to go to !
0 for the last year and a half , my experience goes like this .
0 get cancelled and rescheduled 3-5 times .
0 avoid going here at any cost !
0 very rude and unhelpful staff when it comes to complaints !
0 just save yourself lots of follow-up problems with billing and go to another place !
0 i did n't even have the chance to describe all of my symptoms !
0 the vomit smell is even there at like 8am on tuesday mornings !
0 it deserves zero stars .
0 who are you people giving these stupid reviews ?
0 this place is a nightmare .
0 there is nothing redeeming about this place .
0 the only time i 'm ever here is during a bar crawl .
0 the drinks were worse and painfully weak .
0 i was horrified to see people in formal wear .
0 the tables probably had n't been cleaned in years .
0 drinks are totally average , albeit cheap .
0 do n't they clean the floors ?
0 that was the only reason it did n't get one star .
0 just walk by the place and be overwhelmed by the smell .
0 i 've been in the place once and it is gross .
0 i ca n't imagine going to this place at a peak time .
0 came here _num_ years after my graduation ... and not much has changed .
0 it still smelled like vomit , stale beer , and service sucked .
0 worst bar i 've been to , period .
0 went there to party , fun , but the establishment itself sucks .
0 regretted that in _num_ hours .
0 what an absolute dump .
0 one star is too much .
0 bookstore , but lately i am so far from a fan .
0 i wish i could give _num_ stars .
0 after having read the reviews , i was expecting more .
0 the woman at the counter was friendly , but the food was disappointing .
0 there were flies all over the place .
0 the produce looked so sad and wilted .
0 it was `` _num_ five alarm hot sauce '' level .
0 i could barely eat it .
0 ate here for the second & last time a few days ago .
0 unfortunately this was not the case .
0 the chips are straight from a bag and the salsa was quite bland .
0 why would you put giant pieces of green onion in with the carne asada .
0 these were not pleasant and bitter tasting .
0 very thinly sliced meat that was very chewy .
0 the problem is that it was thinly sliced so it was quite over cooked .
0 the refried beans was a soupy mess , but the mexican rice was passable .
0 pro : none ... .
0 i 'm shocked that they have _num_ stars .
0 let me say , i strongly regret this decision .
0 slowest service i 've ever had .
0 waitress also did not know anything about menu items .
0 i was pretty stupid when i was _num_ .
0 needless to say it was also too crowded , dark and dirty .
0 they said they were delivered so they could not give me my money back .
0 i wasted a trip .
0 very disappointing considering their job is flowers and the flowers they have are terrible .
0 so maybe i am not the target audience .
0 the problem is that the meat is not very good .
0 it reminds me of the frozen gyro meat you can get at grocery stores .
0 the only thing i paid for was the convenience of eating on green st .
0 green street did n't feel the same without you since you burned down .
0 although the ambiance is much improved , my gyro lacked taste .
0 soft , tasteless pitas with bland meat and sauce .
0 the greek salad was n't anything special either .
0 the salad does n't have enough cheese !
0 there are daily specials which is posted on the sign outside .
0 this is where it falls short .
0 the fries that come with the combo is a very small portion .
0 additionally , they are quite stingy with the meat , i.e .
0 overall a little disappointing .
0 not a big fan .
0 i felt too nostalgic here to give this place one star .
0 this place is horrible .
0 the service is very rude .
0 it was a really weird experience .
0 well ... luna still falls seriously short for me .
0 we ordered the shrimp special , which was grilled and came with coconut risotto .
0 the final disaster was the fried gnocchi .
0 i am a big gnocchi snob , and these were so gross .
0 sorry luna , after two attempts now , i 'm not coming back .
0 but , ok , they were short on menus .
0 the menu shortage ( ?
0 one of our _num_ orders came out wrong .
0 the waitress did n't charge us for the soup .
0 however , their new location is n't as great as the old one .
0 we ordered some coconut shrimp , and some ravioli with goat cheese and asparagus .
0 luna used to be my favorite restaurant when it was on campus .
0 i mean purple and bloody , too , not just slightly pink .
0 and the cooks could n't even cook it through the second time ?
0 they did n't apologize or act like they cared at all .
0 the same girl came over and was like , do you have a reservation ?
0 we ordered a salad , melting brie pot and lobster & crab stuffed prawns .
0 the potato totally overpowered the brie and you could barely taste it .
0 so i guess that was a bad selection .
0 they came out ( four of them ) , not stuffed at all .
0 however , the service is so-so .
0 way too expensive for crap like that .
0 the food was ok , a bit overpriced but not awful .
0 like several other reviews here have said , they are just not the same .
0 she brought the table of _num_ four slices of bread .
0 the dishes were extremely underwhelming , and the first _num_ or _num_ were cold .
0 there is no way these could count as tapas .
0 needless to say , very disappointing , not worth the hefty price tag .
0 but this is not a great restaurant ; it 's a lazy restaurant .
0 food was overpriced and low quality .
0 _num_ hours for lunch is too long .
0 then finally after another _num_ minutes , we were being seated .
0 however , this nightmare did not end then .
0 and , we were finally allowed to order after _num_ minutes of sitting !
0 neither the server , nor the host , was attentive and helpful .
0 the server had this terrible attitude toward us the whole time .
0 and the foods were not the best they could be consider the price .
0 was it because we were furious having to wait even with a reservation ?
0 pros : the beignets were tasty and so was the sandwich .
0 i have visited luna four times now and each time is worse than before .
0 the service is soooo slow .
0 there was so much salt on it , i could n't eat it .
0 this place is so overrated it 's not even funny .
0 first and second , i went with a group for brunch .
0 my second trip , our group had reservations and we still waited _num_ minutes !
0 third ( and i 'm afraid final ) visit was a disaster .
0 our food orders were not taken at the same time ; not even close .
0 of course that was all wrong and took another half hour .
0 it 's so cold , loud and crowded .
0 without exaggeration , the food was disgusting .
0 the salmon tasted like it was two weeks old .
0 i would n't be surprised if it came from some frozen bag at costco .
0 i swear on my life this is the worst steak i 've ever had .
0 and it was like _num_ % tough , inedible fat .
0 i could make a better steak when i was _num_ .
0 the lamb chops were so tough , we could n't even eat them .
0 and it was still awful .
0 it was impossible to chew .
0 this was just unacceptable .
0 i could n't find it from the actual review page !
0 then finally after another _num_ minutes , we were being seated .
0 however , this nightmare did not end then .
0 and , we were finally allowed to order after _num_ minutes of sitting !
0 neither the server , nor the host , was attentive and helpful .
0 the server had this terrible attitude toward us the whole time .
0 and the foods were not the best they could be consider the price .
0 was it because we were furious having to wait even with a reservation ?
0 they took down my review twice ... .
0 it was not offensive at all except stating the facts .
0 the staff stare like they have never seen a woman before .
0 threw out a $ _num_ plate of food after finding hair .
0 wait , no , not identical .
0 the main courses cost about $ _num_ more than on green street .
0 the food was okay and plentiful , but the wait service was horrible .
0 however , after the last outing i will not go back .
0 it was a very unwelcoming place .
0 ; and a totally inept management of the tables .
0 sub-par indian food , which passes in town .
0 how is that there is no good indian food in champaign-urbana ?
0 the food here is generic and bland .
0 not worth the money .
0 i walked out with a severe case of food poisoning .
0 $ _num_ for grilled chicken and a few grilled onions is not a bargain .
0 around 9pm , i called again .
0 i tried calling , and no one picks up .
0 then my hunger snapped me back to my senses .
0 the lack of silverware and napkins was a nice touch .
0 i ordered chicken curry , the meat was spoiled and made me throw out .
0 will not come here ever again .
0 the food is just average indian food , nothing special .
0 rice was stale , cold , and hard .
0 incredibly poor food quality .
0 does n't seem like they put any effort into their food or service .
0 i 've ordered takeout before during lunch hours and was always charge lunch price .
0 very disappointed by this experience .
0 i had the dinner at this place few months back and it was disappointing .
0 i had veg assorted appetizer , chicken tikka masala and naan .
0 veg appetizer was ok , rest was not good .
0 they were so oily and soggy .
0 i was hoping samosa will save the day but hell no : ( .
0 the filling was bland , the pastry was neither crispy nor flaky .
0 the only thing tasting good was tea , which was made by me .
0 that 's it , no more trying indian restaurants in champaign .
0 no one should pay $ _num_ for _num_ pages of paper .
0 i did n't like this place .
0 first , the service is slow .
0 gyros are below the average and chicken is too greasy !
0 so , this place is so overrated !
0 what i did n't expect was for my order to take _num_ .
0 but who can turn down amazing chicken strips ?
0 under those conditions , i say go for it .
0 the only thing that kept us coming back was their awesome chicken strips .
0 you 're not allowed to browse and he will frequently tell you so .
0 i was in this shop once when i was picking up my girlfriend .
0 i was just killing time and saw this shop .
0 i have n't been treated that bad in a store since i was _num_ .
0 your little model cars on the wall were filthy .
0 for fast food sandwiches , i vote subway .
0 then she hung up on me without as much as a goodbye .
0 the dogs there are all sad .
0 can we say gross ?
0 it 's not as if i had high expectations ... .
0 literally , i went orange eating it .
0 every time ( no joke ) they have messed up my order .
0 i would not recommend this restaurant .
0 any food would suffer from sitting for an hour .
0 this is the worst chinese food i have ever had in my entire life .
0 a total waste of money .
0 ate here a while ago and did n't really like the food .
0 read the bad reviews .
0 knew it was not going to be that great .
0 got this chinese fish dish that was just absolutely horrible .
0 fish fillet floating in grease with absolutely no taste .
0 avoid at all cost .
0 why go here when there are much better restaurants around .
0 i really love chinese food but this place was absolutely horrible .
0 but why the hell would i do that ?
0 in addition , it 's only steamed rice and not fried rice .
0 however , the food is practically tasteless .
0 this , i have to say is a major disappointed .
0 avoid at all cost .
0 i was trying to find a place to have dinner tonight .
0 the spring rolls were okay , i suppose , though really not that great .
0 the problem was really with the basil chicken : it was honestly quite gross .
0 first , why do they use ground chicken ?
0 that 's just wrong .
0 ground chicken is wrong .
0 and the dish was just not good .
0 i ate a little bit of it and was done .
0 for the next half hour i had a gross taste in my mouth .
0 lesson learned : even thai food is n't always a safe choice .
0 the latter ( basil thai ) is by far the worst .
0 a curry dish with barely any veggies ?
0 no , potatoes do not count .
0 curry is hard to mess up because it has such strong flavor .
0 however , given a choice , why go and have bad food ?
0 however , there are better sit-down thai restaurants in town .
0 nothing but bad service here .
0 the car was not ready when i arrived .
0 he would n't help me out in anyway and was just a terrible employee .
0 i do not recommend it !
0 by far the worst service i have ever had in my life .
0 i did n't even know that was possible .
0 oh god , where do i start ?
0 be warned , this company will absolutely nickel and dime you .
0 staff is rude , inconsiderate .
0 staff is not friendly .
0 i have lived in la , chicago , nyc for many years .
0 but that 's not the worst part .
0 why not appeal to god directly ?
0 i will not be returning to this location for anything .
0 why would i get a service that is n't recommended ?
0 their approach to customer service is bizarre .
0 they stopped the upsell after that .
0 then , i started having performance problems with my tires .
0 i know they can wear early , but that is really early .
0 that explains my poor performance !
0 but , jiffy lube lost me as a customer .
0 worse place in town !
0 when i complained the guy shrugged his shoulders and said sorry .
0 very very rude staff !
0 the food however , was underwhelming .
0 spicy tuna was terrible .
0 the taste was lacking and the rice seemed a bit stale .
0 do n't waste your time .
0 the price may be decent , but the food lacks the same feeling .
0 first of all this is not one of my favorite types of foods .
0 the portions are really small which really did n't bother me .
0 it was about a _num_ inch by _num_ inch square .
0 what really cracked me up was the vegetables .
0 ( and i am not exaggerating , that was what she told us . )
0 the food was horrible .
0 and the service was the worst thing at this place .
0 this is the kind of place that gives sushi a bad reputation .
0 menu presents typical appetizers individual cuts rolls bento boxes and dinners , again typical .
0 worst japanese food in town !
0 we were refused service and told they were getting ready to close .
0 i can not image turning away business in a poor economy .
0 it was strange and somewhat offensive .
0 the problem with this place is the service .
0 we actually had to leave , i had an appointment .
0 overpriced , mediocre sushi restaurant that only knows how to sell atmosphere and presentation .
0 this place does neither .
0 but they put onions on every aspect of my bento box .
0 my below average bento box cost a total of $ _num_ too .
0 the price is n't worth it for the quality or quantity .
0 on a saturday evening , we waited _num_ minutes without anyone taking our orders .
0 waited another _num_ minutes , still no one to take our order .
0 so we walked out .
0 not enough waiters , the chef has to come out to serve by himself .
0 bad management , ca n't hold a dinner service on a saturday night .
0 everyone in the restaurant was waiting for his or her food .
0 my friend and i went there and order ramen .
0 the service is very slow .
0 the ramen is so bad .
0 this place is a joke !
0 first time my wife and i came here the service was awful !
0 we could all smell trash while sitting there .
0 tried to take my wife for a birthday dinner .
0 most of the frames were name brand super expensive .
0 so i go back to get it adjusted .
0 after i left , i noticed that there were scratch marks on the metal !
0 maybe because they did n't want to do business with me .
0 i spent m it was such bad luck that i went to the location .
0 i wish i never had known about the place .
0 it did n't have a lot of flavor .
0 i have been there twice and both times i have not been that impressed .
0 but the fried chicken was not that good .
0 it was really dry .
0 the fish is n't anything special either .
0 when i walked in it was not a welcoming atmosphere .
0 they acted like i was bothering them and i felt rushed to order .
0 maybe it 's because i am not a regular .
0 mac and cheese is awesome but small portions .
0 i love the okra and the collard greens .
0 however their customer service is the worst .
0 the food was just sitting on the counter .
0 i will not come back to this place ever again .
0 went here , was n't aware of what time they close .
0 so we went in and wasted _num_ min .
0 if i could give _num_ stars i would , or maybe even negative stars .
0 the wait is insane .
0 would not recommend this restaurant !
0 the champaign olive garden has declined significantly within the last year .
0 fridays and your applebee 's .
0 well , it 's not like that anymore .
0 i guess the thing is that it did n't used to be this way .
0 but now it 's not .
0 the house salad is awful and so are all the soups .
0 she apologized and said no one had told her that we were there .
0 i ordered bruschetta and salad and my companions had soup and salad .
0 but the bruschetta was just awful .
0 she never refilled any of our drinks and just seemed sort of distracted .
0 no apology , nothing .
0 not complicated to pour some sauce on the noodles !
0 over _num_ hours for an average meal .
0 it 's always slow when we go , but that was just insane .
0 the service was the worst i have had in some time .
0 one bite in we realized the cheese had separated and it was barely warm .
0 very poor quality food .
0 the only bright side of this dinner was the pleasant waitress .
0 our pizza was mushy and undercooked .
0 i could n't eat it .
0 the description was nothing like the actual entree .
0 alas not so good .
0 somehow my two bowls of soup came out lukewarm which was quite disappointing .
0 unfortunately , not a good cut of beef as they were tough and chewy .
0 typical olive garden , standard menu , nothing special .
0 our cups sat empty for most of our meal .
0 we did n't have enough time for our app .
0 i have zero complaints about our food , just the service was awful .
0 good food but lacks a family friendly environment .
0 i did not like the sausage .
0 let me begin by saying that our waiter was very friendly !
0 i am usually extremely satisfied with champaign restaurants but this visit was pitiful .
0 i asked for my salad with no olives , it had olives .
0 i asked for meat sauce with my ravioli , i got red sauce .
0 i asked for a refill on my drink , never got one .
0 she came to our table maybe _num_ times total .
0 i am not sure why this restaurant gets so busy .
0 the garlic and wine sauce was really heavy and not appetizing .
0 salad dressing very sour .
0 : ( i am thinking they do n't have good turnover .
0 the golden moon tea does n't taste like anything i bought from golden moon .
0 but if you love quality and freshness , avoid !
0 the teas i bought from the jar taste stale and bad .
0 overall , there are plenty of better places for chocolates .
0 the menu is basically two choices : steak or chicken .
0 sadly no other steak cut options .
0 i really do n't get some of the reviews of this place .
0 ok , you people need to get out of central illinois more ... .
0 just about the only thing you can order here is a ribeye .
0 but you ca n't get any other cut of meat .
0 the salad bar is terrible .
0 unless you want a _num_ ounce ribeye .
0 let me first describe the restaurant 's ambience .
0 when i was there the restaurant was very busy and extremely noisy .
0 the ribeye steak is low quality meat .
0 eating the steak is not a pleasant or satisfying experience .
0 coleslaw would be on par with that available in a chain supermarket deli .
0 overall , the salad bar is not worth ordering .
0 it just is not very good .
0 bread is a hot , fresh loaf , but mediocre nonetheless .
0 that is , prices are neither too high nor are they particularly good values .
0 service is adequate but unremarkable either way .
0 for me , this all is about _num_ 1/2 stars on yelp .
0 why oh why ca n't we rate zero stars ?
0 knowing how bad the steak is , i ordered the shrimp .
0 _num_ times worse than the steak .
0 hell , even the courier cafe in urbana has a better salad bar !
0 not much flavor , and not a high quality meat .
0 and if that does n't work ask `` what restaurant is your favorite ? ''
0 first time out of maybe a hundred i did n't get a good recommendation .
0 the salad bar was the only redeeming quality .
0 _num_ bucks before the tip .
0 this is not that kind of place , although it thinks it is .
0 the menu offers three options : ribeye , chicken , or shrimp .
0 i do n't mean to trash this place too much though .
0 the ribeye said it was no problem .
0 you can get a mediocre steak for a lot less .
0 the steaks are ok , but thin for the price and always overcooked .
0 the shrimp is ok , too .
0 i am only halfway joking .
0 even with the full house we did not have a long wait .
0 i ordered a _num_ oz .
0 ribeye rare with sauted mushrooms and loaded baked potato .
0 so ordered the _num_ oz .
0 they were not bad , but they were not sauted .
0 steak was below average and service was lacking .
0 i try to avoid them as much as possible .
0 they could n't even offer anything else !
0 once again , a terrible experience .
0 unfortunately we had a gift certificate .
0 i will happily spend that money elsewhere .
0 never even came out of his hole in the back .
0 i do not recommend renting from u group at all .
0 they were extremely rude when my roommate and i called them .
0 the leasing manager is terribly rude and the staff is clueless !
0 when i opened the door the stench was overpowering .
0 it smelled like the last tenant was someone with _num_ cats .
0 and that was nothing compared to the fact it was so so dirty .
0 i spent saturday night in a smelly apartment with no power .
0 horrible apartments and management .
0 first they gave trashy apartment without cleaning .
0 second they do not agree that it is dirty .
0 never rent their apartment !
0 they do not care tenants at all .
0 it 's suffering living in their apartment year round .
0 just a bad experience all around .
0 we tried really hard to keep it away .
0 can you imagine how terrified i was at that moment ?
0 there are _num_ men in my living room and i was in bed .
0 i can not think of a reason for the wall to be painted again .
0 lastly , my friend come to visit me in summer .
0 and the parking lot is almost empty during the summer .
0 so my friend parked at an empty lot .
0 then the car get towed .
0 why do n't you leave a note for a visitor 's car ?
0 you 're new , confused , slightly nervous about everything .
0 in the middle of the shelf , plain for all to see ?
0 not ok at all .
0 and i thought , `` what the hell am i gon na do now ?
0 and i officially hate carrie 's now .
0 also , carrie is not always the most friendly shop owner .
0 did ya look down the hallway , asshole ?
0 so that 's not why it gets _num_ stars .
0 maybe it was the overall lack of options .
0 the people were n't friendly or helpful .
0 but there are problems with other members there .
0 i shop the bulk bins because there is variety .
0 should n't be a surprise , really .
0 i think most things here our overpriced and sub-par quality .
0 do n't go here if you can avoid it .
0 the next day my radiator tank was completely empty .
0 items are overcharged and there is no return policy .
0 very dirty store with dust all over the shelves and items .
0 indifferent and unhelpful personnel does not know the inventory of the store .
0 this company is a complete fraud .
0 do n't give these people money .
0 i would give it zero stars if thats an option !
0 we were stranded at the bus stop for _num_ hours in the cold wind !
0 no specific schedule for the next bus !
0 for dry cleaning they are extremely expensive .
0 they have lost our business for good .
0 well , no more .
0 on top of it all -- they are extremely expensive .
0 i used the fluff and fold service _num_ times .
0 the first time , i was missing some pants .
0 so that forced me to go there again .
0 do n't support this business please .
0 my husband brought in a suit and a $ _num_ coupon .
0 the fee for the suit was $ _num_ .
0 his charge should be $ _num_ , right ?
0 well , they charged him once for $ _num_ and again for $ _num_ !
0 however , now that it has happened twice , i do not trust them .
0 i drove down there with receipts .
0 it 's a shame it was the one closest to my apartment .
0 when i went to pick up my dry cleaning , the cover was gone .
0 needless to say , i wo n't be returning .
0 we used the laundromat and it is wicked nasty .
0 if i could give these movers a zero , i would .
0 so we used these folks -- it was a disaster from the beginning .
0 i 'll echo what another reviewer said : _num_ star is _num_ too many .
0 after two hours the movers never showed .
0 thirty minutes later no one shows and i call and cancel .
0 save yourself the worry and avoid like the plague .
0 she promised a quote the next day , which i never received .
0 your stuff will be _num_ weeks late , with broken and missing items .
0 if i could rate this company zero stars , i would .
0 very unhappy and unsatisfied customer .
0 the food was just okay , nothing to rave about .
0 as far as specialties go , i 'd say , the diner stack ?
0 i gave them another shot a few weeks later , this time for lunch .
0 diner with overly hovering waitresses and bad orange juice .
0 crispy yet soft , i could 've had platters of this thing .
0 maybe that 's snooty , but i just hate it .
0 they looked me in the eye but never acknowledged my presence .
0 unfortunately , champaign has a lack of diners and _num_ hour restaurants .
0 ( and the quality delivered is mostly poor . )
0 service _num_ stars , food _num_ stars , atmosphere _num_ stars .
0 i would have to say that the wait staff is top notch .
0 the sausage and eggs were good without complaint .
0 overall with the oil and salt , it was somewhat difficult to eat .
0 ordered a mega omelet with no ham , it comes back with ham .
0 the customer service was just that bad .
0 when i pointed it out to the waitress , she just shrugged .
0 so disappointed in the whole experience .
0 however , we were not asked if we wanted more .
0 wrong , not if they do n't ask you if you want more .
0 he also took my salad before i was done with .
0 he did n't bother to ask me if i was done with it .
0 they were so slow .
0 they were really salty and just ... well , not good .
0 we also split a burger , which was decent , but very very heavy .
0 i think i maybe had _num_ bites of it .
0 i refuse to go to tgi friday 's in champaign anymore .
0 however , truly bad service is inexcusable .
0 this is n't what bothers me .
0 at another restaurant i 'd be totally willing to forgive and forget .
0 i liked the fried green bean appetizer with wasabi ranch sauce quite a bit .
0 i wo n't be back .
0 normally things here are ok - nothing fantastic .
0 i got exactly _num_ tiny chunks of avocado and zero cilantro .
0 in addition , it was a hot mess .
0 the arrival of our food was the second disappointment of the night .
0 talk about bad presentation !
0 needless to say , he finished it but still went home hungry .
0 this is all on top of the ridiculous prices they charge .
0 almost $ _num_ for _num_ mozzarella sticks ?
0 $ _num_ for a small steak ?
0 bad values all around .
0 horrible , horrible , horrible .
0 the service was bad and the food was worse .
0 i love chain food but this place is awful .
0 i doubt i will ever go back to a tgi fridays at any location .
0 i ordered some sort of pasta alfredo with chicken .
0 the pasta was so overcooked it was mushy .
0 the chicken was so overcooked i could barely cut into it .
0 save yourself the time and money and avoid this place .
0 it was pretty trashy for the otherwise very nice atmosphere .
0 this place is an absolute joke .
0 it 's extremely overpriced ( $ _num_ for a solo ham and cheese crepe ?
0 and i asked for cheddar on top - what the hell ?
0 $ _num_ for shitty american shredded cheese ?
0 this is not the case here .
0 she then disappeared for the entire meal and came back only for the check .
0 thanks but no thanks .
0 i ordered a $ _num_ ham and cheese crepe .
0 once they took his empty soup bowl away , the wait began .
0 we probably did not get our food for another 20-30 minutes .
0 and again , there were _num_ other parties of _num_ in the restaurant .
0 no one even looked at us .
0 i do n't know why they could n't have used white flour .
0 the food is good but the customer service is awful .
0 not worth the hassle .
0 i took my children here while visiting my sister in champaign .
0 it was nothing like it .
0 we could barely fill up _num_ minutes here .
0 the water interactive display had no water in it .
0 the sand exhibit was missing some sand .
0 there were about _num_ people crammed into the main room , paying .
0 charlie and the chocolate factory was playing , but there was no volume .
0 i am not kidding .
0 these people are clueless .
0 we complained and were reluctantly given our money back .
0 what a sad , sad place .
0 to begin with , the place was dirty .
0 it looked like no one cared about it .
0 do n't be fooled .
0 i would n't recommend it .
0 dirty - everything is dirty and dusty .
0 plus - $ _num_ to get in ?
0 when the food showed up it was just as bland as the chips .
0 the food though , has much to be desired .
0 last night we went there and i got chicken tacos .
0 they were so horrible that i only took one bite .
0 they were that bad .
0 the chicken tasted like it was canned .
0 as the saying goes : i 've got _num_ problems .
0 getting the order wrong and forgetting a side ?
0 unfortunately i should have followed the negative reviews .
0 the rice was drenched in grease .
0 it even smelled bad as the waiter put it in front of me .
0 omg out out a bag , just horrible .
0 too mad for them because , as i said , i love mexican food !
0 everything was drowned in a red sauce that tasted canned .
0 however , our server was a really nice guy .
0 not very authentic , and my rice was severely undercooked .
0 they used yellow cheese on my tacos .
0 much better choices for mexican food in champaign .
0 unless you buy your tickets several weeks in advance .
0 did i mention i 'm having a slow day at work ?
0 it should n't be a big deal to go to chicago .
0 it should n't use up all my money or my patience .
0 chicago is a major travel hub and the closest major city .
0 the fact that it is so difficult to get to hurts the university .
0 the delays have ranged from _num_ hour to _num_ hours .
0 the american fries were a soggy mess and also without flavor .
0 did these reviewers eat the same stuff as i did ?
0 it was soggy and relatively flavorless .
0 do n't know what i ordered here but it was dirt cheap .
0 probably less than $ _num_ .
0 you get what you pay for but the food is cheap quick and easy .
0 there 's an _num_ % chance that sam could be serving you .
0 i 'm definitely never going back .
0 no clue how this has _num_ stars .
0 french toast was hidden like a pancake .
0 we were completely disappointed and frustrated afterwards .
0 so we sat down and the service was just terrible .
0 he talked way too fast and barely gave us time to respond .
0 did n't like him at all .
0 * another problem we had here .
0 there seems to be only one cook .
0 they talk about that customer as if she was in the wrong .
0 another problem are the extremely small tables .
0 but that is where it begins and ends .
0 but other than those two things , i see no positives about this place .
0 stood in there for twenty minutes before anyone noticed us .
0 four tables without people , all covered with plates and trash .
0 we were told it would be awhile because there were no tables .
0 incredibly rude , clearly do n't care for customers or loyalty .
0 will not be returning .
0 the food was just s bit too greasy and eggs were over cooked .
0 they serve the typical junk food and it is very crowded during the weekends .
0 they have a few specials too , so do check those out .
0 i was in champaign last week , on a wednesday evening .
0 murphy 's was the only place with their kitchen open after 10pm .
0 i ordered a mega bacon cheeseburger and fries .
0 service here was terrible .
0 all in all , a terrible meal .
0 either way , that was a bit annoying , so strike two .
0 what i was served was a ridiculously gross , flavorless hockey puck .
0 so , thanks , but no thanks murphy 's .
0 folks , i highly advise you to pass this place up .
0 do you get the idea it was bad ?
0 skip it and save yourself a possible trip to the dentist .
0 _num_ stars for tradition , _num_ stars for food quality and _num_ for service .
0 the female bartender that took our lunch order had zero personality .
0 i 'm glad it was n't a problem .
0 i 'd recommend drinking here at night , but not eating .
0 what a shit hole !
0 it was almost _num_ in the afternoon and i sat at a pub table .
0 it smells like dick cheese in here mixed with vomit and under dried towels .
0 i do not understand how this bar continues to exist .
0 but _num_ just leaves me speechless .
0 my point is , they have _num_ drink craftsmanship .
0 food : food service is poor though the food is fairly good .
0 if i were working all night i 'd get hungry too .
0 eh , this place was alright .
0 next off , i had the burger .
0 the fries were mediocre at best .
0 the onions were overwhelming and there were too many potatoes and not enough mushrooms .
0 i also asked for my eggs to not be runny and they were .
0 in a skillet that can be gross .
0 i only gave them two stars because that is what i truly feel .
0 as i said , food was mediocre .
0 wo n't try it again .
0 it just seems every time i go , something is n't right .
0 so on saturday i ordered the la petit french toast .
0 these reminded me of pancakes at ihop : bland tasting black holes for syrup .
0 originally i would have given this place _num_ or _num_ stars .
0 the server seemed annoyed and did n't assist me with any other options .
0 i ended up with _num_ eggs and a bowl of plain oatmeal .
0 slow service would n't even refill my drink .
0 interior is dingy and the tables were sticky i would not recommend this place .
0 it was n't horrible but it was definitely forgettable .
0 greasy old restaurant carpeting dirty .
0 $ _num_ for spaghetti ?
0 then the restaurant filled up and the service was non-existent .
0 but frankly , next time , i 'll go to the olive garden .
0 all in all i do n't know what we will ever go back .
0 i am in hopes the owners eventually make me want to return .
0 that just is n't possible ! ''
0 um , why would that be , exactly ?
0 they were t exactly busy but , ok , whatever .
0 so then the bill comes .
0 then , i looked at the bill .
0 sadly , none of that is true now .
0 needless to say , we warned the next people who attempted to sit there .
0 still no sign of my food .
0 by now it 's been ten minutes .
0 i flag down the next passing employee , who happens to be the manager .
0 i tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund .
0 the drive through wait was longer than i had expected but not the worst .
0 she said she was just checking to be sure they were there .
0 i prefer a crisp cold salad like most people .
0 however , the ring of onion on it is very hot .
0 overall the booth 's were simply sticky .
0 worst customer service ever !
0 the worst i never had a problem with this in the past .
0 if they had run out would n't just put a sign up ?
0 nope just to lazy to change it .
0 as well no napkins in dining room at all !
0 and i always get sad because it is so gross in there .
0 i got there late and there was no seating .
0 i would give this place zero stars if i could .
0 this place is totally overpriced , and they 're sloppy .
0 also , the massage chairs suck .
0 okay , so i went back to give this place a second chance .
0 needless to say , i definitely wo n't be coming here again .
0 they are rude and do a horrible job .
0 i 'm do n't giving this place a chance .
0 he cut my cuticles so low they started bleeding .
0 if i could give this less stars i would .
0 this place is completely shady and horrible .
0 would never recommend to anyone else .
0 worst pedicure of my life .
0 somehow i find that their food is kinda bland .
0 so first things first , they do n't accept cash .
0 so i order one of the specials , which is tofu soup and fish .
0 so yeah , the food is okay , not too bad .
0 the owner was irritated as promised in other yelp reviews .
0 the boss trying to sell me something they want to sell , which sucks .
0 and the food is very low quality in all the korean restaurant .
0 never has a restaurant left more of an impression on me .
0 i have never felt worse after a meal or left more dissatisfied .
0 you could not pay me $ _num_ to eat the food i ordered again .
0 neither of us had eaten all day .
0 that 's _num_ cents an ounce .
0 the entire plate of nachos probably cost them $ _num_ .
0 apparently `` smothered '' burritos actually means fucking coated with nacho cheese .
0 you can tell i really hate this shit .
0 the beef in my tacos was ground fine .
0 the beans were the texture of a watery soup .
0 the chicken taco was edible .
0 i was starving though .
0 i did n't touch the nacho cheese coated burritos .
0 you could tell the servers did not like working there .
0 our server did n't bring us the check .
0 also , the service was mediocre .
0 she was n't even bad , she just lacked a personality .
0 yuck , this place has really gone down hill .
0 the chips had no salt and the salsa tasted like ketchup .
0 it looked like baby food and did not hold together at all .
0 our server was attentive , i ca n't fault him .
0 we saw that on fridays they have a $ _num_ frozen strawberry margarita special .
0 they were n't even worth eating .
0 business is closed as of the end of november _num_ .
0 the bar portion also pretty bad .
0 it 's always hard to get the attention of the bartenders .
0 beer is n't great and it 's relatively expensive for what it is .
0 they also have a terrible patio in the back .
0 on top of that the food is n't really very good .
0 so it fails at being a bar and sports bar .
0 they came back from the bar after another 20+ minutes without drinks .
0 not to mention the utter lack of life on a friday night .
0 i want to punch that guy so bad .
0 i am so glad me and my friends do n't go here often .
0 the fries were cold and the service was less than desirable .
0 i do n't recommend anyone go to the champaign hooters .
0 food really , really bad .
0 i gave it _num_ [ $ ] just because it so overpriced .
0 this however was the worst food i have ever had at any location .
0 the chicken was so dry and cheese sauce was hard and tasted disgusting .
0 i just wanted a beer and the service was horrible .
0 maybe because it was monday night and the c team was working .
0 walked out after sitting for _num_ minutes - no service .
0 empty tables all around .
0 we will not return to this place and never recommend to our friends .
0 maybe i 'll give it another try .
0 i 've never had such a horrible and disgusting excuse for fried rice .
0 there was nothing in it .
0 the chicken did not taste like general tso .
0 it was not spicy .
0 it was not flavorful .
0 dry , tough , stringy , chewy .
0 peking garden was a weird case for me though .
0 at the time , i would have almost gave it a _num_ star rating .
0 i was glad i did n't though .
0 the service was also bad this trip .
0 it was not fun especially since we both had to work later that day .
0 she informed me that it was carrots , onions , chicken and sauce .
0 it did n't even contain carrots or onions .
0 she replied , `` i do n't care ! ''
0 i wish i could rate _num_ stars .
0 the man yelled back and then hit him again .
0 no one should go to this restaurant .
0 something about the ambiance of the place puts me off though .
0 needless to say i was none too happy and gave up .
0 the sausage is still good , but everything else tasted like crap .
0 my daughter had the pancakes with link sausage .
0 the vegetable soup was ok but it had a lot of corn in it .
0 ordered a full order of biscuits & gravy , the meal came fairly quickly .
0 it was hot as well .
0 everything else ranges from okay to awful .
0 this place is the worst .
0 however , that does n't make up for the rude service .
0 they are rude to their customers and act way more important than they are .
0 i explained to them that due to a condition i could not sit differently .
0 _num_ cats are ok in most places , no dogs .
0 washers and dryers in the complex sometimes work , usually do not .
0 also , outside and inside lights are quite frequently not working .
0 every single item on the list was checked to be cleaned .
0 that is outrageous and appalling .
0 this lasted at least _num_ months .
0 do not go there !
0 i am very disappointed in the pedicure i received today .
0 the whole experience was rushed , which made me feel very uncomfortable .
0 this lady ( the owner ) had an overall rough touch .
0 worst bar i 've ever been too .
0 pay $ _num_ dollars for cover and expect a complete waste of your money .
0 not even a hello or good morning !
0 this mall has really gone downhill in the past few years .
0 it seems as though no stores can survive there .
0 the food court is really nothing special .
0 i left the place and will not recommend it .
0 they do n't know their head from their ass .
0 the guy said they did n't sell anything like that .
0 _num_ people behind counter but i couldnt get waited on .
0 will never walk in store again .
0 the warranty will be valid , just need to contact customer service .
0 this required me to take a day off from work to receive the bed .
0 i feel like i am not a very valued customer .
0 i was not satisfied with my stay .
0 it had a cheap feel to it .
0 there was a time _num_ years ago when la quinta was a quality brand .
0 what really irritated me was the pricing .
0 a king bed is $ _num_ more than two beds .
0 better than most chain pizza , it 's ok .
0 its awful cardboard with some sauce and cheese on top .
0 i did not like the pizza .
0 the waitress seemed to be a little rude .
0 slow service and bad food .
0 the pizza is just ok .
0 the appetizers are frozen and low quality .
0 service is always slow and they constantly forget basic things like straws .
0 cheap and perfectly adequate .
0 the kind of place you order from because it 's close and cheap .
0 they have some , but very limited in type and variety .
0 anyway , plenty of other bars that would be happy to have my money .
0 no , i do not need your assistance .
0 no , i do not want to discuss my weekend plans with you .
0 no , i do n't care anything about you or your life .
0 but the more i went , the less they seemed to want me there .
0 i 've learned cutting curly hair dry is almost always a disaster .
0 avoid at all costs !
0 also , the salon was a sauna !
0 overall , it was a really horrible experience .
0 awful , amateur job .
0 _num_ of the last _num_ times i 've been the order has been wrong .
0 i did n't realize either time until i got to work .
0 i 'm guessing they ca n't leave after work stars and neither can i .
0 went there numerous times and my orders have been messed up .
0 i hate this mcdonalds .
0 i 'm not exaggerating .
0 i 'm dead serious .
0 the worst quality mcdonald i have been to .
0 the other side is missing .
0 terrible service and management .
0 this is a terrible place for anybody looking to enjoy themselves .
0 if having fun is not your thing , check out fat city .
0 the second time i went was a tuesday night .
0 the worst i 've experienced in champaign-urbana .
0 drinks took literally _num_ minutes .
0 never heard or experienced any thing like that before .
0 worse cleaning i have ever had .
0 i showed up _num_ minutes before my 2:00 o'clock appointment as requested .
0 not `` chinese food '' .
0 just same things fried in same sauce .
0 i did not get them at panda express at the mall .
0 it was filthy and smelled so rotten i wanted to vomit .
0 should n't that shit be in a cooler or something ?
0 what probably should have cost her $ _num_ cost her $ _num_ .
0 they only accept cash , probably because they make up prices as they go .
0 really do n't recommend to shop in this store .
0 lots of foods are expired and still on the shelf for sale .
0 that 's not the reason why i 'm giving far east _num_ stars .
0 i 'm not sure what is going on with that .
0 i would avoid the meat .
0 and i would avoid the produce .
0 check those expiration dates though .
0 you will often buy expired food and food without expiration date .
0 can not imagine the poor quality of some food .
0 they just put expired food at the most obvious place on the shelf .
0 not a happy girl here .
0 would not do again .
0 her excuse was that my frames were to `` beat up '' .
0 i scheduled an appointment , then received a call the day before the appointment .
0 `` we ca n't take new contact appointments after 4pm . ''
0 `` we ca n't accept new contact appointments after 2pm . ''
0 this time i did not reschedule .

0 something 's very wrong .
0 pizza is not anything to write home about , that is for sure .
0 why wo n't yelp let me give zero stars ?
0 the animal emergency clinic of champaign is a scam .
0 the original surgery itself was n't much more than that !
0 , but gave us back a dog that was covered in blood .
0 i brought my dog in who was very sick and not doing well .
0 humans do n't even get charged this much for simple iv therapy !
0 i do n't get it .
0 it 's not worth the visit .
0 now , super _num_ is ... a super _num_ .
0 i 'm so sorry , pops .
0 there is even a nicer super _num_ near lincoln avenue .
0 honestly , do n't stay here unless every other hotel is booked .
0 we waited too long to book and this was all we could find .
0 the sheets in the bed looked clean but they were very worn .
0 i just did n't want to touch anything in there .
0 we booked the room through priceline , only paid $ _num_ for room .
0 i do n't need fancy , i just need comfy .
0 it was so gross !
0 old , smelly , & creepy .
0 ( of course my hubby would point out they had old tvs too . )
0 my hubby called to say he could n't stay there .
0 he went next door to la quinta for $ _num_ .
0 because i booked through priceline i was not allowed a refund .
0 this should tell you it is not ok to stay there !
0 room size and cleanliness were acceptable and so was was the continental breakfast .
0 the room smell made the stay uncomfortable .
0 in fact , it was awful .
0 i reluctantly accepted the response and scheduled my appointment .
0 they talked on the phone the next day and he was extremely rude .
0 they do n't care about anything except for your money .
0 and the second visit totally ruined my hair .
0 for sure will never ever go there again .
0 first , it 's very pricy .
0 it 's not worth the price .
0 after a few months , i gave a second try .
0 i went here to find out about wedding dress alterations .
0 i would not recommend .
0 she did n't know the warranty plans when i asked her .
0 even sold the wrong size ring to us after we tried it on .
0 i go here a lot because i live nearby .
0 also i wish the dim lighting and the weak espresso could be improved .
0 i guess i 'd try this place once more , just to be fair .
0 not really a fan .
0 $ _num_ for a pint of pasta salad ?
0 $ _num_ for a cup of yogurt with _num_ blueberries and some granola ?

0 i just feel that the are n't very attentive .
0 i dunno , new hire ?
0 for the listed reasons , the latte was given zero stars .
0 avoid until they get over themselves .
0 man was i disappointed by my experience here .
0 the woman said `` no i do n't need to run it again .
0 however , it rang up as _num_ .
0 why should i bother shopping here ?
0 almost everything was well over $ _num_ per meal , even the staple stuff .
0 second problem : no leftovers .
0 first off , our waiter only understood about _num_ % of what we said .
0 he did n't understand and sent the manager over .
0 i cook thai food at home .
0 this was the must disgusting restaurant i have eaten at in years .
0 i was obviously disgusted and i told the waiter .
0 he ran away because he did n't want to deal with it .
0 i tried to get his attention but he was ignoring us !
0 also , the few bites of pad thai that i did have were awful .
0 not flavorful at all .
0 i will never be back .
0 potato in the curry tasted like it was canned .
0 no authentic thai flavors .
0 but eating there is just kind of depressing sometimes .
0 i wo n't be back .
0 this was the worst thai food i 've ever had !

0 the conversation with the owner was unbelievable , laughable at best .
0 she demanded to know what else we ate .
0 lived in _num_ e white st , champaign for half a year .
0 anyway , never resident in _num_ e white !
0 however , i am a very clean tenant and did all my cleaning .
0 if you are thinking of renting here ... do n't do it !
0 the apartments are not in good shape considering that they are fairly new .
0 it is sad how continually they are allowed to take advantage of their tenants .
0 the construction is getting ridiculous at this point .
0 this is not right .
0 it 's not fair .
0 i want my rent back .
0 that 's just not right .
0 today is april _num_ , _num_ .
0 the apartment is a mess .
0 they do n't care about their tenants .
0 they , i quote , are `` dogs '' .
0 everything was ok after move in although the furnishings were dated and quite worn .
0 this unit is by far the worse unit you can possibly get yourself into .
0 the apartment itself was disgusting ' !
0 i fell sick the first week .
0 ca n't wait to move out of this company .
0 by far the worst place i ever loved at in my life .
0 they do not care at all about you .
0 i really do n't get what the big deal is with this place .
0 this place is over rated .
0 given all this , the $ _num_ entrees on the specials menu were surprising .
0 to top it off , service was poor .
0 you have been warned .
0 so , went here on a busy saturday night .
0 for burgers that cost around $ _num_ , i would expect a lot more .
0 it 's nothing special , neither good nor bad .
0 i tried it twice , it underwhelmed on both occasions .
0 the service was n't good .
0 poor beer , wine and food selection ( as in no selection ) .
0 tortilla chips come standard and it 's extra for fries ?
0 no pink in sight .
0 she may as well have said `` you 're not welcome here .
0 frankly , i 'm not sure when we will go back .
0 im gon na sum this up quickly .
0 and i smell like a resturant !
0 wo n't go back nor will i suggest anyone go there .
0 horrible , maybe burgers are good , but i do not like being ignored .
0 the hostess is terribly rude and nasty .
0 the seating is horrible .
0 the last time i was there the food was good but really slow .
0 we walked in and asked for a table for two .
0 something to drink ( even after ordering drinks it took over _num_ minutes ) .
0 nothing particularly good to say about the food .
0 it was fine , i guess , but why is it so expensive ?
0 location : kinda lousy , service : kinda lousy , food : kinda meh .
0 after our lunch both of us felt really bad .

0 the worker over there is rude !
0 this place has the worst service ever .
0 too expensive for what it is .
0 the ham was just awful and there was way too much cheese .
0 no bike rack , so brought bike in .
0 did not allow it and could not offer an alternative location .
0 usually go in car , but no more .
0 unlike the poster below i did n't find them particularly polite or apologetic .
0 unfortunately i also think that language is a barrier .
0 excessive grease is used .
0 also , avoid goin on the thursday nights .
0 they have a stupid live band .
0 however , as time went on , the food quality slowly started to slip .
0 no bread , no water , no hello , nothing .
0 however , too little , too late .
0 nothing of that is left , the memories barely .
0 of course , we expected a small piece of freshly cooked tuna .
0 my stomach did n't thank me .
0 bottom line : avoid like the plague .
0 you could n't pay me to go back .
0 i miss the old downtown champaign location .
0 my friend and i had the saffron risotto and it was horrible .
0 it was n't creamy , in fact , it was soupy and bland .
0 the shrimp was overcooked and tough .
0 worse , i could n't even taste a hint of saffron .
0 needless to say we were not impressed .
0 the pasta was of an unappetizing soft texture and the dish was overly greasy .
0 the prosciutto tasted more like salted pork .
0 their only redeeming feature was the crab cake appetizer .
0 the meal started with bread , olive oil , and cheese for the dipping .
0 for my appetizer , i chose the sausage in crust .
0 the small side of greens was nicely dressed but rather limp .
0 the latter was fine , the former was nothing special .
0 slowest service i 've ever had in my life .
0 the hostess was the one who helped us .

0 i will avoid this subway until they get this problem resolved .
0 night at _num_ pm to pick up a sandwich .
0 the place was empty .
0 the nice guy behind the counter told me they were out of tuna salad .
0 the whole attitude was bizarre .
0 well , it 's the next day and it looks like garbage .
0 there is no way that i can go to work with this .
0 avoid this dude at all costs .
0 the bar is dark and a little dusty .
0 the drinks are worth trying but it is not great .
0 so , i ca n't study or do research while in there .
0 i miss this place .
0 not that that is a bad thing for college .
0 honestly i would never go back to this bar .
0 however , the place is pretty nasty .
0 even when you do get served , it appears everything is really expensive .
0 $ _num_ for a bottle of miller lite ?
0 loud , but good music ?
0 full of disrespectful and dirty kids .
0 and there is no way to get out of line either .
0 oh , except this party also charges $ _num_ cover .
0 drinks are very weak .
0 too loud to hear anything .
0 not a fan , at all .
0 i effing hate this place .
0 i agree , quite likely the worst subway on the planet .
0 the employees do not care _num_ % about you , or your order .
0 it 's old technology and it needs to die .
0 but its too expensive .
0 one good thing is that the drinks are ridiculously cheap .
0 shots are $ _num_ , pitchers can be as low as $ _num_ .
0 the employees were incredibly rude and were just standing in the ladies room .
0 their food was typical and not memorable and the beer is only okay .
0 given the choice , i would choose other bars over joe 's .
0 the waitress , i know not her name , was incredibly rude and inattentive .
0 hello , rude waitress .
0 nobody tipped , and the food was lukewarm by the time she served us .
0 what a horrible waitress .
0 she really should be fired .
0 service was horrible from the start .
0 second biggest problem is that nothing comes out at the same time .
0 only _num_ waters came out , before the best _num_ .
0 also , between each visit from our waitress , there is a long wait .
0 only thing worth anything was their perfect onion rings .
0 it 's also unfortunate that their _num_ bud light draft special was broken .
0 if you really want to try this place come for half off burgers .
0 i 'm thoroughly disappointed .
0 needless to say we wo n't be back anytime soon .
0 one of the worst bars on campus .
0 like there are much worse things going on at this campus than this .
0 if your not _num_ do n't even bother showing up .
0 it can be good , it can be bad .
0 never attempt to order food for delivery from here .
0 it will take well over an hour and be ice cold and mushy .
0 there is much better sober food .
0 worse yet they keep very inconsistent hours when students are away .
0 horrible food , only slightly more mexican than taco bell .
0 also pretty much identical to chipotle , which might be slightly better .
0 not worth the price .
0 also the lines at lunchtime can be ridiculous , which is sad .
0 on top of that , their hours are all over the place .
0 never any lines to worry about here !
0 and my lettuce was rotten , wilted and brown .
0 makes me wonder whether the meat is beyond its expiration date too .
0 an empty restaurant like qdoba speaks for itself .
0 i waited _num_ minutes and no one ever showed up to open the shop .

0 convinced me i needed a cap , i did n't .
0 my first visit i went for normal x-ray and cleaning covered by insurance .

0 the service is rude here .
0 in short : food is decent but service is horrible .
0 it went smooth enough though , and my order came fast , within minutes .
0 i probably could have done better at home .
0 the biggest problem is their service .
0 that was extremely rude and i was quite offended by it .
0 food was greasy as hell .
0 how do you mess up a fried rice ?
0 i ate it with my chopsticks .
0 this is a review for their sunday night trivia .

0 i do n't like the idea .
0 the greek one was a disaster .
0 it was supposed to have sausage , but i could n't taste any .

0 the salmon only cost $ _num_ and it was a fairly big portion .
0 the servers were nice but the atmosphere was too load .

0 no steak for me .
0 i ate 1/2 of the serving and left the rest .
0 they were gummy and flavorless .
0 the salad bar was unremarkable , but not bad .
0 in my mind a reservation at _num_ means you get seated around _num_ .

0 if i closed my eyes i would n't be able to tell them apart .
0 the only flavor that seems to be good here is the chocolate .
0 otherwise , save your money and your time and just go somewhere else .
0 it did not live up to all the fuss .
0 they guy that took our order clearly had no clue what he was doing .
0 even then it took forever for our order to be made .
0 on the other hand , i ended up literally drinking it .

0 these guys deserve better than that .
0 every time i have been , the bar has been understaffed .
0 it 's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment .

0 hours it takes to swap them out ?
0 still not good enough .
0 i know a little something about cars .
0 my uncle has been a mechanic for over _num_ years .

0 _num_ min later they started coming out , sort of .
0 do n't think i 'll go back to dine in - ever .

0 the place was busy and noisy .
0 the menu was limited and average priced for most items .
0 the hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice .
0 so sadly we will not be returning .
0 after no response , i went in ordered food .
0 food was delivered _num_ minutes later .
0 then adding insult to injury the food was bland when it arrived .
0 not worth the time or money solid _num_ stars .
0 nothing bad but nothing special .
0 it was mostly broth with few veggies .
0 the green papaya salad was bland needing more lime juice .
0 the cheesy _num_ 's radio station did n't help .

0 his response , `` ohhh sorry !
0 i could n't believe it .
0 i got charged $ _num_ for a dish we could n't even eat .
0 a manager did n't even come over to try to smooth this issue out .
0 i left nothing for the tip considering they were ok to rip me off .
0 i wo n't be back .
0 my wife and i were very excited to try this place based on reviews .
0 the staff was very nice , but a little slow it seemed .
0 my wife told me that her seafood panang was relatively bland .
0 no offer to refund the meal was offered .
0 a few other issues with service but minor compared to routine food poisoning .
0 the manager refunded my entire tip in cash .
0 have n't been back and will likely never return .
0 unfortunately the service was absolutely appalling .
0 she took even longer to collect the bill and run our card .
0 extremely disappointed with my experience and i will not be coming back .
0 there were only three couples inside including us .
0 the service was unacceptable .
0 from the moment my friend and i entered the restaurant the experience was bad .
0 it took a long time for us to get water or our drinks .
0 eventually our entrees came , i ordered soup , it was n't good .
0 it was almost impossible to manage .
0 then our check came , he overcharged us .
0 the restaurant was not busy , it was typical for a wednesday night .
0 there is no excuse for their wait times or rudeness .
0 really disappointed - place is not as good as it used to be .
0 the hostess was nowhere to be seen .
0 no sign of the hostess .
0 other people have arrived and walked out as well .
0 maybe they 'd get one of the still empty tables .
0 that girl probably just cost the restaurant thousands in future business .
0 when the dish came out , i was so disappointed .
0 $ _num_ extra for two shrimps !
0 we were told it would be about _num_ mins .
0 do n't expect customer service !
0 if you ca n't handle the heat , then get out of the kitchen !
0 i could n't believe what i was hearing !
0 we left the restaurant and i will never return .
0 big fat f for this place .
0 the flavors and preparation is just not authentic .
0 needless to say , this was very disappointing .
0 two stars for service and cleanliness alone , none for food .
0 the food was fine but the service was atrocious .
0 we flagged down another employee who got the waiter .
0 really , where were all the servers ?
0 it was also disappointing to me that the bill was not clear .
0 they would do well to make the customer feel a little more welcoming .
0 the basil chicken was not much better .
0 watery sauce and minimal flavoring .

0 we waited _num_ minutes for our food .
0 the wait staff was great but the management was sloppy and hands off .
0 it was n't busy at all , but our server was not very attentive .
0 a large group would not use any of these open tables .
0 instead my time was wasted .
0 i could see the owner busy cooking in the kitchen .
0 i would suggest she spend a little more time on the front .
0 why are n't you tasting the food that your cooks are putting out ?
0 pad thai was terrible ... very salty , not sweet at all .
0 i could n't believe my eyes .
0 two stars today for a very poor meal last night .
0 its not that great .
0 the chicken pad thai is pretty decent , but i have had better .
0 my second trip here was not great at all .
0 it was a piss poor excuse and they were n't that apologetic .
0 will not be going back .
0 it seems like every time we come here there 's a line .
0 you decide which is more important .
0 for me , there are plenty of better thai places in the area .
0 but the service is so bad that it hardly makes up for it .
0 so we walk in , it 's not very busy .
0 she looked at me like i said something foreign and refused and said no .
0 she did n't answer , gave me a dirty look and we walked out .
0 i 've never experienced anything like that .
0 absolute horrendous customer service .
0 in _num_ degree heat , we were refused .
0 even more , i am disappointed that the staff behavior was so appalling .
0 the food is terrible .
0 pad thai is mediocre at best .

0 over all it was a poor experience .
0 two waitresses ignored us , one cleaning a table that was obviously not needed .
0 she said she would get a hostess .
0 waited _num_ min for a cold dinner .
0 we went on a saturday night and there were plenty of tables available .
0 ca n't complain about the chicken pad thai because it was great .
0 i ordered chicken pad thai .
0 it was mediocre and the service was bad .
0 when i asked her for chopsticks , she just walked away .
0 only because i ca n't give them _num_ stars .
0 they really need to get it together .
0 supposedly they do not take reservations , but they were unable to seat us .
0 i left barely eating the dish .
0 not worth taking anything home .
0 went there with a group i 'm in .
0 disappointing to say the least !
0 poorly handled from start to finish .
0 too bad , because i 've heard good things about this place .
0 the rice was n't fresh .

0 i rescheduled but after this i plan to never go back .
0 thank you for your reply to this _num_ months later .
0 so glad this nightmare is behind me .
0 keep in mind , this was the 1st time i had met her .
0 just know that your patients surely do miss you .

0 the problem was the dry and hard food .
0 the beds were comfortable .
0 they have a pool , a jacuzzi , and a workout room .
0 the staff is n't so great .
0 it was a roof over our heads .
0 it is not a great hotel .
0 on top of that the pull out bed was uncomfortable as hell !

0 their change machine was down for well over a week !
0 `` hello , did you find everything you are looking for today ? ''

0 seems like half the time i go there they do n't have it .
0 it was really rude and unprofessional .
0 another thing , the starbucks thing is ridiculous .
0 did we really need another one ?
0 it pains me to say , this safeway is horrible .
0 does n't corporate come by every once and a while ?
0 every time i go , they 're out of something .
0 i '' m talking basics .
0 bread , milk , soda .
0 i just do n't ever recall that a sandwich required silverware .
0 the time prior , i went and they were out of tomatoes .
0 walk over to the produce and pick up a tomato !
0 but sadly , it 's the closest store to my downtown office .
0 this safeway is ghetto ... for arizona .
0 none of the employees are helpful nor friendly .
0 the products are all grossly overpriced .
0 this is a terrible location .
0 very random and sketchy .
0 the huge problem here , is everything else .
0 it makes for an unsafe situation for everyone .
0 it really seems like this store just does n't give a shit .
0 at each opportunity to impress , the complete opposite happens .
0 the last time was my last time ever walking into either safeway store .
0 i do n't know how they get away with selling moldy fruits and vegetables .
0 can i give this _num_ stars ?
0 i am so disappointed in this safeway and will not return .

0 i apologized and was only met with more attitude .
0 what the hell is that smell inside the store ?

0 the $ _num_ minimum charge to use a credit card is also annoying .
0 sorry but i do n't get the rave reviews for this place .
0 the desserts were very bland .
0 the cake portion was extremely light and a bit dry .
0 it was super dry and had a weird taste to the entire slice .
0 once again , i have n't figured out why they change so much .
0 even in the awkward freezer burn then microwaved scent .
0 my goodness it was so gross .
0 i ca n't even handle how gross it was .
0 went here for the first time to try something new ... bad idea .
0 expensive , lack luster burgers .
0 the `` chicken '' strip were paper thin oddly flavored strips .
0 the big chicken sandwich should be called the big mayonnaise sandwich .
0 fries are n't worth coming back .
0 now the service i experienced was bad .
0 i ended up here by accident ( not a happy accident ) .
0 the chicken tenders did n't taste like chicken , wtf ?
0 so i only had half of the regular fries and my soda .
0 crap fries , hard hamburger buns , burger tasted like crap !
0 i 'm so disappointed !
0 but service was horrible both times .
0 the spicy chicken sandwich was small and basically all lettuce .
0 sorry they closed so many stores .
0 the people behind the counter were not friendly whatsoever .
0 i wanted to like this place so badly .
0 charging $ _num_ for an extra shot in an espresso drink is plain ridiculous .
0 i just got a plain ole cup of joe .
0 so i waited 10+ minutes and after the fact they said its $ _num_ .
0 had they informed me of the charge i would n't have waited .
0 that 's why they get the score i gave them .
0 if i could give them a zero star review i would !
0 however my recent visit there made me change my mind entirely .
0 sorry not my style nor taste .
0 - oh and terrible tea !
0 they close earlier than posted hours .
0 i wish i could give zero stars .
0 i really really wish i could .
0 this place does not provide adequate care to any of its horses .
0 you provided none of those services for our $ _num_ !
0 that leaves you no excuse .
0 all play and no work makes horse owners sincerely pissed off .
0 i wont even get in to how badly you treat your dude string horses .
0 you do n't deserve any animals !
0 cons : a cockroach problem that has n't been fixed by the management company .
0 the interior is old and generally falling apart .
0 tl ; dr version at bottom .
0 this place is bad news !
0 still down btw ) .
0 quickly found out they like to close for `` breaks '' all day .
0 old managers always gave us discounts , but melissa refused .
0 which was _num_ am , every morning , for weeks .
0 worst was when we had to break our lease early .
0 it was never done .
0 tl ; dr version : sketchy as hell !
0 if you do , make sure you get everything in writing !
0 these people will try to screw you over !
0 okay so this place has been a pain even after i already moved out .
0 the last months were the worst .
0 the shower has backed up with sewage two times in a _num_ day period .
0 you will find both in your apartment , without fail .
0 front office : customer service does n't exist here .
0 there is not enough parking for the amount of cars per apartment .
0 if i could give less than a star , i would .
0 maintenance is equally incompetent .
0 mission rock have done none of those things .
0 about two weeks later , my ac broke ( in august ! )
0 this apartment community is horrific !
0 my college daughter has had the worst experience living here .
0 i have never had pizza like this in chicago .
0 it was a bed of lettuce and spinach with some italian meats and cheeses .
0 i asked wtf and they did adjust it when i complained .
0 village inn , home run inn .
0 i do not like anybody 's pan pizza in phoenix .
0 not good enough to go back and eat the pizza for though .
0 i am just not a fan of this kind of pizza .
0 just not for me .
0 the crust was kinda gooey like .
0 they were really nice i just ca n't stand this kind of pizza .
0 however the atmosphere lacked , mainly because there were no tvs or music playing .
0 the sauce was way too sweet for my taste .
0 a pre-made frozen pie shell is what they are using .
0 pizzeria bianco - sit down joint .
0 no delivery option though !
0 too many good artisan pizza places in town do go back .
0 i have spent more money on bad pizza than i like to think about .
0 it is a pretty efficient way to get patrons in and out .
0 the pie showed up shortly after the salad was consumed .
0 defiantly not my favorite pie .
0 unfortunately , the sauce pretty much overwhelmed the other ingredients .
0 almost tasted like honey barbeque sauce instead of pizza sauce .
0 the answer was none .
0 we have been there _num_ times , with an attempted 3rd time .
0 1st time , burnt pizza , was horrible .
0 wo n't go back .
0 also like all spinatos they are closed on monday .
0 the food was bland ... if you like spinatos , just avoid this location .
0 it 's not worth it .
0 friendly staff , but not overly helpful .
0 we got the thicker crust and it tasted really dry and hard .
0 the pizza sauce is also way too sweet .
0 it tasted more like a dessert some bites .
0 too sweet for me , but maybe you 're into that ?
0 pretty disappointed it did n't live up to the hype .
0 the sweet sauce was not that great either .
0 mozzarella had very little cheese flavor .
0 over priced , poor value .
0 first time i had a bad experience here .
0 server brought it out to me having not asked which one i wanted .
0 super annoying to find that out during the meal .
0 constantly got in peoples way as they were trying to sit down .
0 really dissapointed wo n't go back .
0 however this was a huge disappointment .
0 italian sub would have been delicious except for the over cooked roast beef added .
0 the flavoring was off .
0 unfortunately , our experience did not live up to others ' experiences .
0 the italian sausage and peppers , however , were fine .
0 `` , check took another _num_ minutes .
0 they updated their meatball sub and it is awful ?
0 we use to go 1-2 times a week and we have n't been back !
0 they do n't seem to care either .
0 sorry spinatos you made a huge mistake .
0 may be only the bread to you but that bread made the sandwich .
0 it use to hold the meatballs in and it was not messy .
0 raise the price do not lower the standard of quality .
0 now i am at home with lots of crust and no sauce .
0 this was not the case .
0 personally i 'd rather spend my money at a business that appreciates my business .
0 great pizza but no wine or beer !
0 thats just not italian !
0 the bad service of the waitresses make me dread going sometimes .
0 and if i go , i 'll pay cash and sit at the bar .
0 i 've noticed the food service sliding down hill quickly this year .
0 to my surprise , they were completely out of wings .
0 we never want to let a loyal customer down .
0 no contact what so ever .
0 bars must be a bad business for making money .
0 i drink beer so ill still be a paying customer .
0 no one was shooting on it because the lights where burnt out above it .
0 how much do _num_ light bulbs cost these days ?
0 i will miss your patio and cheap , cheap appetizers .
0 this place leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to decor .
0 my family popped in for a bite after they got off the plane .
0 which is pretty bad since they 're not really ones to give negative feedback .
0 if you 're feeling lucky , go check it out .
0 v is for very , very , extra ordinary .
0 not extraordinary , kids - just ordinary .
0 i was disappointed after having been spoiled with the great pho other places .
0 i am truly annoyed and disappointed at this point .
0 but wait , what about the broth .
0 i ordered pho tai : the soup tasted salty , lacked depth i.e .
0 my pho was terrible .
0 just got off the plane and needed some lunch .
0 bottom line : disappointed !
0 customer service was bad .
0 the restaurant was dark and did n't even turn the lights on .
0 it was n't for the mood either , probably to save electric bills .
0 the water tasted bad , and worst of all , the food tasted horrible .
0 seems their broth just has no flavor kick to it .
0 it 's not terrible but there are better pho places out there in tempe .
0 i tried once before and i thought it might be a fluke .
0 went back today and the service was even worse .
0 i walked in and sat down at the only available table .
0 the waitress dropped off the menu without ever looking at me .
0 i wiped the spilled pho and hot sauce down with napkins .
0 eventually , my pho was dropped off at my table .
0 i seriously do n't know how the place manages to pass health inspections .
0 do not , i repeat , do not waste your money at this place .
0 thankfully i did n't order pho because the bowl my buddy got looked terrible .
0 greasy layer of fatty broth .
0 pretty much a hole in the wall status but it was n't good .
0 the only plus was that the service was decent .
0 i would n't recommend coming here .
0 i went to the grow shop and the same bag was _num_ !
0 they only want your money at sea of green .
0 _num_ weeks and a lot of bus fare later - part still not in .
0 i hate this place now , and you should too .
0 what a terrible way to treat a customer .
0 they had one ... but not cheap at all !
0 the replacement was expensive .
0 one not so bad time does not make me loyal .
0 the older man there said it would be $ _num_ .
0 that is not how you make & keep customers in the long run .
0 what a ridiculous thing to say .
0 very low integrity bike shop .
0 larry came out and allowed me to take it for a spin .
0 afterwards he proceeded to build up the bike as an awesome deal .
0 `` well those walmart bikes are poor quality .
0 that 's why i 'm returning the bike . ''
0 i ( and apparently many other customers on yelp ) recommend shopping somewhere else .
0 this place is garbage !
0 worst sales experience ever !
0 edit : after reading more reviews it appears they do this often !
0 this was hands down the worst sushi i 've ever had .
0 my tempura was undercooked and gooey on the inside .
0 my husband 's meal was tiny and drowned in overly salty brown sauce .
0 seven hours later i finally arrived at my chosen destination ... crazy fish .
0 i kinda really wish i 'd gone somewhere else .
0 my boyfriend and i went there one night .
0 it was n't that the place was busy -- far from it .
0 overall , i would not return to this place .
0 should n't have bothered .
0 i placed a to-go order for my sick partner .
0 and then charged me nine dollars for it .
0 but salmon and cream cheese is $ _num_ .
0 sub par sushi ( at best ) and terrible service !
0 he never said hello , or even looked us in the eye .
0 needless to say , we left the restaurant and will never return .
0 never again , crazy fish .
0 the only reason why i gave it _num_ stars is because of the staff .
0 pissed off and will never go back again !
0 no wonder you have no customers .
0 do n't waste your time or money .
0 i should have know when i walked in and there were only _num_ tables .
0 i think i 'm going to be sick .
0 they overcharge and the service advisor lied to me about my car .
0 i went back , paid my $ _num_ and picked up my car .
0 he found nothing on my car to work on .
0 they quoted $ _num_ .
0 so they wanted to charge me another $ _num_ to fix this .
0 after they said it was fixed just a week prior .
0 i went back about six months later to just get an oil change .
0 for a dealership to tell him he did n't need work was amazing .
0 you will get robbed here by very friendly mechanics .
0 the next three companies that came in where all significantly under their quote .
0 waited _num_ hours and i did not even receive a phone call .
0 that night the air conditioner kept running and the temperature never dropped .
0 before i wrote this review i made sure it would continue to work properly .
0 it 's a few weeks later and i have had no problems .
0 i 've experienced better , much better .
0 the prices are too high , the food is mediocre .
0 there are too many better lunch options in the area .
0 what happened to them , on saturday they looked like they were doing business .
0 from the moment you walk in you can tell the employees hate being there .
0 probably never going there again .
0 i got to the counter and they literally would not let me use it .
0 they come in plenty of flavors like red , green , orange , etc .
0 it was fun then , but i got older , it wore on me .
0 with the summer heat , fat tuesdays frozen drinks are appreciated .
0 i think i have hated fat tuesdays since they started opening in the valley .
0 the loud music will probably never let you down however .
0 apparently i stand corrected and this place is still open .
0 being in this bar makes me feel dirty .
0 the music is always insanely loud ( and not even good , usually ) .
0 fat tuesday 's is one of my least favorite places on mill ave .
0 i 've never had the food but the drinks are so-so .
0 and i should hate it .
0 the national drink of the florida keys is the rum runner .
0 it 's a cocktail that is pretty much impossible to find north of miami .
0 but fat tuesday 's has it .
0 well , all fat tuesday 's besides this one .
0 whoever had that idea should be fired .
0 if your like frozen drinks , this is your place .
0 but i want more than just frozen cocktails at a bar .
0 i went here this past saturday and the place was packed .
0 somebody needs to get bar rescue into this place .
0 the atmosphere was too dark and somewhat musty .
0 the bartender who finally welcomed me was arrogant and lazy .
0 if he was trying to be funny , it did n't work .
0 the worst thing any business can do is to insult the customer .
0 sadly , fat tuesday does not hold a candle to it .
0 mainly because the bartender was so incredibly rude .
0 um , i 'm sorry ?
0 did you just laugh at a buying customer for their drink order ?
0 i wanted so badly to love this place .
0 it 's that bad .
0 not because of the alcohol in my drink , but because of the sugar .
0 it was like they dumped _num_ lbs of sugar in each machine .
0 not _num_ minutes after finishing my drink .
0 you do n't charge $ _num_ for very little , bland tasting crawfish !
0 the crawfish itself was small too .
0 i do n't think i had more than _num_ whole crawfish .
0 i wish i can post a picture to justify my disappointment .
0 was actually there tonight .
0 it was so sugary that i did n't want it .
0 so lame it makes me laugh .
0 oh wait , not i 'm not .
0 i was sad that modern tequila bar closed .
0 i will never ever , ever , ever , ever go here again .
0 when i asked who his boss was he refused to give that info .
0 worst customer service i have ever received in a long time .
0 do n't waste your time .
0 not prepared for world cup .
0 she said game would be over , before i would got food .
0 she said they did n't have enough time to prep food .
0 should have left but i did n't want to miss game .
0 and leave the single person with poor service !
0 if i could give a zero star i would .
0 verdict : i wo n't be back .
0 if i could give this place zero stars i would .
0 fortunately i caught myself and did n't fall onto their nasty floor .
0 i had n't even drank anything yet .
0 do not go to this establishment .
0 hence i would not recommend them or use their printing services again .
0 they gave us a smoking room even though we requested non-smoking .
0 why smoking rooms even exist anymore are beyond me .
0 like $ _num_ - $ _num_ .
0 outdated hotel for the price , room i was in was dirty .
0 the less than good - really low shower heads .
0 no extra blankets or pillows in the room .
0 * tub would not drain & remained half full !
0 this one is the worst we have ever stayed in .
0 i later printed out the reservation and the desk reduced the rate .
0 no tv remote in the room .
0 the comforter on one bed smelled like pee .
0 i still have n't received it .
0 we were really disgusted !
0 the front desk staff were helpful though thankfully and gave us a full refund .
0 i feel as though possibly i just have high standards for thrift stores .
0 okay despite everyone 's glowing reviews this place is absurd !
0 we left without making a purchase and i will not be back .
0 they have bottles stuck here and there all over the place .
0 but i ca n't get over the awful service .
0 i guess i 'm spoiled when it comes to liquor stores .
0 _num_ ) absolutely no organization in the wine section .
0 _num_ ) the aisle are ridiculously tiny .
0 thank goodness the store was empty tonight .
0 _num_ ) almost half of the wine and liquor bottles were covered in dust !
0 it does n't take that much effort to clean up the store .
0 that just seems like a sin .
0 ( cheaper than texas , not as cheap as cali . )
0 it 's not worth your time .
0 my wife and i recently attempted to patronize this liquor store .
0 what a disaster this place is .
0 i have never had a more frustrating experience in a liquor store .
0 the problem is , i was n't looking for beer .
0 immediately , i know something was wrong .
0 i show him the list of _num_ or so bottles on my iphone .
0 never coming back here ; sketchy employees and overpriced beer .
0 seriously probably the worst corner store ever .
0 the staff are ... well , you could n't hire worse individuals .
0 great selection of beer at reasonable prices , what 's not to love ?
0 he says nothing and does n't even acknowledge me .
0 tops liquor , this guy is losing you business .
0 just be warned if buying beer here to check this sort of stuff .
0 my food arrives quickly after i finish trying the eggroll .
0 finally , after over a week , mike called me .
0 _num_ hours later i called at the number he gave me ... voice mail .

0 luckily , a competitor that did call back got the job .
0 they have n't done anything after we signed the contract _num_ months ago .
0 do not use this company !
0 i have spent _num_ separate stays here .
0 i was quite disappointed and ate only half the fish .
0 but again i was greatly disappointed in the food .
0 there was a police report on the seat .
0 the sheraton did not even attempt to contact us & tell us what happened .
0 this happened _num_ or _num_ days before we came home .
0 the sheraton did nothing in the way of covering the broken window up .
0 they would not even refund our money we had paid for parking .
0 what a horrible representation this person , william is for sheraton .
0 my experience here was terrible !
0 could have stayed at the w for that money !
0 rather not stay here again tho .
0 i was not very pleased with the quality of this hotel .
0 -the a/c is not good .

0 ordered room service , the food was cold .

0 the carpeting looked kind of dirty and it was musty smelling too .
0 the wifi is horrible .
0 the air conditioner was noisy .

0 you 'd have better luck finding gold then an ice machine here .
0 i left three messages without a call back .
0 our stay over the weekend here was horrible .
0 we were lied to on many occasion by different staff and they were rude .

0 did all my appointments to get this .
0 the staff is rude and the dr. does not spend time with you .
0 i cant rate him he gets a _num_ in my book .

0 so i sit down and grab a magazine .
0 turns out he does n't know much about football .
0 he does n't watch basketball .
0 it was n't a terrible haircut but definitely not what i was hoping for .
0 been here a couple of times thought i would write a review .
0 avoid the male barber with the black hair .
0 this is probably the worst barber shop .

0 but i do n't think i 'll be back .
0 but oh no , the burger nazi could n't leave it at that .
0 he just repeated exactly what he had said , this time even more defiantly .
0 forget it , i 'm never returning .
0 the food is tasty but eat it at your own risk ... .
0 i came here on a monday night around 9pm .
0 nothing too unique about the taste .
0 fries though were crispy and fried well .
0 the ambiance was pretty depressing .
0 this place is very affordable but the food is nothing special .
0 second , my dad makes better burgers .
0 you can find better , cheaper burgers at in-n-out .
0 it 's not like i was trying to skip out on him or anything .
0 the food was n't anything extraordinary .
0 you put your own toppings on , which were your standard toppings .
0 the fried zucchini were pretty good .
0 but the service is terrible and the burgers are mediocre .
0 the first time i went , my order was wrong .
0 i had to wait another few minutes for the guy to fry the bacon .
0 the cashier gave me a disgusted look and pointed at the cash only sign .
0 this place seems promising but ends up falling short .
0 the chuck box makes a good boring burger .
0 they fall short of their topping options .

0 the guy checking us out was so rude .
0 nasty place , i will never go back .
0 i made a mistake coming here .
0 now i have no problem going into shit holes .
0 i really did n't want to touch anything it was that dirty .
0 talk about poor professionalism immediately called corporate and stepped outside and spoke to joe .
0 they did not fit him , so i wanted to return them .
0 this location leaves much to be desired though .
0 i wo n't be wasting my time and money here again .
0 the worst part is a hide behind honesty when their just full of crap .

0 the onion in the onion rings were non-existent , all breading .
0 you 're better off going to long john silver 's .
0 the same approach is taken with their fish patties .
0 so bad i do n't even know where to start .
0 i checked the ratings on yelp before visiting this place .
0 it was over priced for what it was and not worth it at all .
0 came out to just under $ _num_ .
0 the shrimp were flat out awful .
0 fried fish should have a light batter .
0 in fact , nothing should ever be fried in the batter they use .
0 i saved the worst for part of the meal for last .
0 that stuff was awful .
0 then why is the food so expensive ?
0 it certainly is n't high quality .
0 it certainly is n't any good .
0 bad fish + bad shrimp + bad sauce + bad fries = _num_ star .
0 worst fish and chips i have ever had .
0 and their pete 's sauce sucks hard .
0 this location sucks balls .
0 the guy taking over was n't a doll either .
0 the shrimps i got here were over battered and overcooked , though .

0 just take your business elsewhere .
0 i 'm sorry but i definitely will not be coming back .
0 fried shrimp were very tough and tasteless .
0 did n't try the chicken or burgers and wo n't be back .
0 the downtown mesa location is like another restaurant .

0 no messy fish sandwich ?
0 are you kidding me ?
0 that 's like no big mac at mcdonald 's !
0 please comment and follow me for more reviews !

0 around 9:00 am , i got a call from someone named sean .
0 upon having the car , oil changes takes a really long time .
0 that 's right , the actual dealer was better customer service than these people .
0 he gave me the list price .
0 i mentioned that i found the same car elsewhere for less .
0 he told me that i should buy it elsewhere .
0 he gave me a low price to trade my car in .
0 he is not someone i would have hired as a manger for my store .

0 he is in no way professional .

0 the walls are paper thin and it is noisy !
0 paper plates and plastic utensils .
0 do n't stay here unless you do n't like sleep .
0 first , there was poor communication with hotel about airport shuttle .
0 after lengthy wait , had to pay for cab .
0 upon arrival , found out the place is being remodeled .
0 the entire lobby is a disaster .
0 i asked for email confirmation stating this .
0 it 's a disaster .
0 not marriott standards ... or maybe it is .
0 marriott seems to be sliding while hilton is improving .
0 hot sweaty nights in phoenix as a result .

0 two problems occurred when we stayed here with our _num_ month old .
0 there really is n't any excuse for not having a few more high chairs .

0 to add insult to injury , i was still starving when i left .
0 what a weak meal !
0 i 'll will never go back to this establishment again .
0 caffe boa is about as exciting as bulk trash pickup day .
0 oh , yeah , i get it .
0 it ended up sitting there getting cold while we ate the salad .
0 remember the variety of flavors and the attention to detail ?
0 there was nothing like it in tempe at the time .
0 the biggest complaint was that our service was awful .
0 we were n't dressed any more poorly than most of the people here .
0 and to add insult to injury , my drink was supposed to be flaming .
0 on my plate was a half order of salad and three ravioli .
0 i miss them all and want them back !
0 caffe boa used to have the best happy hour on mill .
0 the food tasted good , but man ... .
0 hard not to think that you 're getting taken for a ride here .
0 cafe boa appears to be an institution headed for disaster .

0 all in all we ordered three bottles of wine ( for _num_ ! )
0 the bill came and only one of the bottles was 1/2 off .
0 clearly not our expectation .
0 he simply said there was nothing `` more '' he could do .

0 now they have a handful of their worst ones .
0 i 've changed my rating from one star to two stars .

0 people like this are not the norm of course .
0 alas , you never called .
0 without you , i might have never found them .
0 having dined here many times before , the service is indeed usually much better .
0 the taste of basil is completely lost as is the balsamic vinegar .
0 not something we would recommend or order again .
0 they used to have several great salad options , now they only have three .
0 it looked like they have less pasta too .
0 it 's not like we took a long time to order .
0 when it finally came , my turkey sandwich was kinda blah .
0 even the red pepper mayo on it did n't add much life to it .
0 i want my old caffe boa back !
0 looking at the lunch menu i chose the meatball panini .
0 that 's when things went downhill .
0 can spaghetti be spaghetti without noodles ?
0 can a meatball panini be a meatball panini without meatballs ?
0 i think i 'll stick with defalco 's for my meatball sandwiches .
0 not even a water .
0 at this time , we were probably the third occupied table in the restaurant .
0 and a bit pretentious .
0 to be honest , none of the food was worth the price tag .
0 caf boa you 've lost me .
0 i was disappointed at my last lunch experience and this one takes the cake .
0 i miss my old modest reliable boa .
0 i felt specially taken advantage of and specially pissed off .
0 this new menu is as ridiculous as the prices for average food .
0 case in point : a $ _num_ lunch special ?

0 the food is just ok - rather average .
0 strange happy hour menu - deep fried pork belly fat .

0 although the duck was cooked correctly , the rest of this dish was inedible !
0 last but not least , there was the dessert course .
0 hands down the worst preparation of creme brulee i have ever encountered .
0 there was a about _num_ people in the whole place .
0 the gnocchi were over pan seared and filled with grease .
0 i could n't finish the dish .
0 sadly , i thought the service and food were terrible .
0 at those prices average does n't cut it in my book .
0 the menu is kind of limited .
0 they were not stuffed full of seafood , they had some seafood .
0 you do not get what you pay for here .
0 however , no one came to greet us .
0 she did n't apologize for the situation .
0 she just said she would find someone .
0 we eventually got the beer but no bread .
0 could he not have mentioned that before we had to ask again ?
0 i will not go there again .
0 the only good thing was the ambiance .
0 then all of the sudden , he did have the time .
0 we walk in and half the tables in the place are empty .
0 they 're trying to get your bill up with alcohol sales .
0 it was $ _num_ .
0 it was tiny , about _num_ small pieces , and tasted gross .
0 the sauce reminded me of salt and vinegar chips .
0 over priced , disgusting scam .
0 so so so so so boring .
0 the lobster ravioli may be the most overpriced , overrated dish on the menu .
0 $ _num_ for _num_ tiny ravioli ?
0 what 's worse is that the filling tasted like imitation crab .
0 it was the worst thing on the table .
0 a half portion is more than enough for the average individual for lunch .
0 unfortunately , that was the highlight of our meal .
0 a few things pissed me off because i absolutely love this place for dinner .
0 the `` brunch '' food was ok although it was nothing special or memorable .
0 failed attempt at good cuisine .
0 only place in the city to get rabbit but very poorly done .
0 not a good meal .
0 i mean honestly , $ _num_ for their `` special fries ?
0 $ _num_ for bruschetta ?
0 however , my visit over the weekend was less than good .
0 the server was really slow .
0 there was n't much in the way for vegetarian options on their current menu .
0 neither of us wanted to finish the dish .
0 had we just left it at that , our experience may have been better .
0 so why the low stars ?
0 so , i returned .
0 i will not go back .
0 honestly , i ate bread to fill myself up .
0 i brought some leftovers home ... you want some ? ''
0 i 'll miss it a bit ... some of the food was amazing .
0 i wanted to like this place , i really did .
0 however , at that point , it went downhill so fast .
0 but then , our waitress was noticeably absent most of the time .
0 forever to get the bill .
0 just absolutely terrible service .
0 the staff missed or got multiple orders wrong , some never came at all .
0 $ _num_ for an appetizer size bowl of soup is absurd .
0 $ _num_ for a basic caesar salad ?
0 the food was all good , but terribly overpriced .
0 would return for the food , but not at these prices .
0 tonight has been completely unacceptable !
0 it took more than _num_ minutes to take our order .
0 after waiting about _num_ minutes we were seated directly inside the front door .
0 justin suggested the macarons for dessert -- they were incredible !
0 did we get free wine for our wait ?
0 _num_ minutes later there was still no bread and no supper .
0 being hungry , tired and frustrated we left .
0 so far , no call .
0 i still have the stupid groupon to use .
0 an hour later , we still had n't received it .
0 i probably would have enjoyed it more had the service been better .
0 food is acceptable , service is terrible .
0 however , do n't always expect to have their daily offered selections available .
0 i will not be going back here a 4th time .
0 really , caffe boa , you know better .
0 because it sure did n't show up for brunch today .
0 i am not sure who remembers that this place had an old location .
0 the new place ... meh , not so much .
0 nowhere near as cozy , its more like a corporate bar .
0 oh caffe boa , i do n't even know where to start !
0 i am very disappointed caffe boa !
0 we were seated and had to wait 5-10 minutes for anyone to approach us .
0 the food was good but not at all worth the expensive prices .
0 there are much better restaurants in the area like house of tricks .
0 food takes forever to arrive , bread not refilled nor water .
0 _num_ dollars + _num_ dollars for meat for my pasta dish .
0 _num_ dollar fries did not arrive either .
0 all in all a lack luster experience .
0 bread brought out with the meal was hard and dry .
0 no butter or jam was offered .
0 it was n't fresh squeezed .
0 all in all everything was less than acceptable .
0 sadly i wo n't be back .
0 cafe boa was just okay but there are way better places out there .
0 we spent close to $ _num_ for subpar dinning .
0 i probably wont come back here .
0 and my girlfriend chose a pasta and a salad .
0 none of the ingredients matched what we read .
0 the food was good , but the service was lackluster at best .
0 better luck next time !
0 probably one of the worst dining experiences in my life .
0 i was so embarrassed we took others here , too .
0 so , we arrive , after making a reservation for _num_ .
0 _num_ of the group order a cocktail .
0 immediately after that , it came out .
0 it was somewhat dry .
0 it appears that you are supposed to get bread before you meal .
0 we did n't even get offered any .
0 i really can not say enough bad things about this place and our experience .
0 came here for lunch with a friend and was disappointed .
0 to me , here is where it got a bit frustrating .
0 the piece of chicken seemed to be well breaded and fried too long .
0 overall , she was not impressed with her meal .
0 the waitress was a nightmare !
0 overall great food but horrible service that turned me off to go there again .
0 and at that time , it was unbelievably good in every way .
0 i have been here twice and my main meals were terrible .
0 dry and flavorless , blah .
0 i said nope just a foodie who experienced terrible service and food .
0 it was worse than the first time .
0 no bread , no water .
0 not sure the hype here .
0 maybe both my times were bad ?
0 no , i do n't think so .
0 they must not taste their own food .
0 dry , flavorless , under seasoned and boring after the 3rd bite .
0 i will never return to this place .
0 slow service , food was bland , and was way overpriced .
0 the only reason this place gets _num_ stars is because of the interior .
0 unfortunately for $ _num_ this left me hungry and craving some flavor .
0 there are better options in neighboring scottsdale or even in tempe .
0 what a waste of time and money .
0 cafe boa used to be a great place to dine .
0 im not sure why they even open the doors anymore ?
0 i would n't waste a penny more on this old has been !
0 the problem was the waitress .
0 but the tea never came and the waitress never checked in on us .
0 we did n't even get any waters or the chance to flag her down .
0 just returned from my last visit to cafe boa .
0 i sit down to a filthy , paper menu .
0 she brings my tea and _num_ packages of sugar .
0 next i order a salmon caesar salad .
0 it arrives and the salmon is dry and flavorless .
0 i wo n't go there again .
0 if you 're a vegetarian , skip dinner .
0 just removing the meat does n't make a dish appealing .
0 tonight i went here for dinner on a date .
0 the restaurant was relatively empty - sunday night at _num_ .
0 i ordered the mushroom ravioli that was very undercooked .
0 there was no offer to make it right .
0 she just cleared the plate and offered the dessert menu .
0 her lack of concern was surprising .
0 this was not my first disappointing experience at this restaurant at this location .
0 hands down worst service i have ever had a restaurant .
0 she was very rude about it .
0 $ _num_ and no croutons .
0 and this place will not give you a piece of regular italian bread .
0 bread to scoop up all that sauce ?
0 nope , you ca n't get it at this place .
0 but you ca n't get a piece of freaking italian bread .
0 went to cafe boa the evening of march 3rd , _num_ .
0 however we waited almost _num_ mins to get our food .
0 the manager was totally unprofessional .
0 i ordered their turkey sandwich , which was $ _num_ .
0 i am not exaggerating .
0 do n't order a half meal of ravioli and salad .
0 did you know there 's only _num_ ravioli in the full order ?
0 other than that , was not very impressed at all .
0 the menu looked impressive but the end food result was very lacking .
0 i do n't like paying for an expensive meal that is not good .
0 the $ _num_ salad i ordered was tiny and extremely bland .
0 even the $ _num_ peach appetizer just was n't good either .
0 the prosciutto did not taste right .
0 i just assumed that all business do that for their customers .
0 cafe boa does not validate parking .
0 however , their service is truly terrible .
0 needless to say , reservation canceled only _num_ hours before the party !
0 we visited cafe boa on saturday night with a 7:30 reservation .
0 our experience was so disappointing on many levels .
0 today 's adventure was their rueben ... it was almost totally inedible .
0 do not bother coming here .
0 but the food , for the most part , is not .
0 worse yet , service was pleasant but very very slow .
0 the dinner was ok , nothing special and was small in portion .
0 first , i brought cup cakes , they were not cut .
0 butter lettuce , walnuts literally that 's it with salmon .
0 probably wo n't eat there again .
0 i went here on saturday night for a friend 's birthday dinner .
0 it was very disappointing .
0 the fries were okay , though some were covered in chili powder .
0 we tried to find her , but we could n't see her anywhere .
0 she essentially gave herself a $ _num_ tip on a $ _num_ bill twice .
0 the food is fancy but is n't worth the price .
0 okay , anthony did n't tell me the specials nor the soup .
0 i would n't have ordered it if i knew it had meat .
0 anyway , bill comes & there 's a $ _num_ charge for the wine .
0 no one is here anthony says .
0 no one is ever here this early .

0 large , well run and stocked indian grocery store .
0 fried food , burgers , wraps and seafood are a dime a dozen .
0 everybody raves about this place .
0 just because a lot of people go there does n't make it amazing .
0 but , its impossible to get a table .
0 i agree with the poor reviews on this place .
0 i have found the food to be expensive and very boring .
0 the drinks are ok , the beer is ok , the atmosphere is ok .
0 however , i do n't , so i wo n't be returning anytime soon .
0 i have been here twice and both times sucked .
0 however , it is also highly , highly overrated .
0 for a real hole-in-the-wall , find a hole-in-the-wall .

0 it 's just not that cool .
0 there 's also never any place to sit on a busy night .

0 it 's just plain bad .
0 patrons above the age of _num_ .
0 asshole cops that follow you home afterwards .

0 it 's just a different type of obnoxious .
0 this place is for folks with too much to prove .
0 i do n't smoke cigarettes .
0 this place barely has an interior .
0 i do n't get this place .
0 before we could even say anything , she had left .

0 i 'm not sure how to describe them .
0 do n't waste your time here .
0 it 's a pain , and confusing .
0 music sucked , a bunch of shitty trendy crap .
0 the only thing redeeming were quality servers .

0 believe me , there is no next time .
0 customer service does not exist here .
0 parking also can be difficult .
0 my last visit , however , really changed my perspective on this place .
0 it took over one and a half hours for us to get our entrees .
0 the balance of the whole sandwich was lost .
0 parking is rough and it 's a packed house especially on a saturday night .
0 first off i am _num_ , but no stick in the mud .
0 i write to save another business traveler the trouble of a horrible dining experience .
0 it is filled with college kids drinking cheap beer .
0 _num_ of them bad from looking at them .
0 they look bad , they will taste worse .
0 swimming in that cheap teriyaki goo they sell at any restaurant supply store .
0 everyone else stay far , far away .
0 i guess i could be in culinary hell here .
0 so bad in fact that i sent them back .
0 this place is constantly over crowded , and the staff is rude .
0 the second time i went with my husband and ordered a crab salad sandwich .
0 so , this place was already two for two .
0 but the service was horrible .
0 but let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry .
0 if i could give it zero stars i would .
0 i could n't believe my ears !
0 i have never been treated so badly in a restaurant before .
0 the people who own this business have no idea what they 've lost .
0 however , this is not the final straw for me .
0 so long casey moore 's .
0 maybe i order poorly , but my pasta was lame .
0 like i said , confusing !
0 the food was not impressive .
0 the fish was mediocre ... the batter was thin , not crispy at all .
0 it had no salt , flavor , or seasoning whatsoever .
0 the side dishes were met with the same lack of seasoning .
0 the fries were limp and had absolutely no salt .
0 i was not impressed at all with the property or location .
0 like i mentioned before .
0 the service is not spectacular either .
0 i walked in and was greeted by no one .
0 this was my first visit and needless to say my last !
0 this was the worst place ever .
0 in my burger , there was some mystery meat that i bit .
0 i would n't recommend this place to my worst enemy .
0 food , service , parking and decor are horrible .
0 the inside looks like a haunted house and the outside is a complete wreck .
0 i quickly paid my tab and got out of there .
0 it might have been because we did n't look like hipsters .
0 maybe we did n't have enough visible tattoos .
0 after our nice long wait for our food , the food was wrong .
0 our waitress was obviously bothered by our requests to get our food correct .
0 i forgot who ordered what but the sandwich was missing the bacon .
0 unless you have very low expectations of what a bar/restaurant should be .
0 but even then i think this place would disappoint .
0 and apparently there is a bread shortage if you order clams or escargot .
0 the service here was absolutely horrible !
0 i arrived and it was fairly empty .
0 two waitresses split between _num_ people at _num_ tables .
0 by far the worst service i 've ever had at a restaurant .
0 ate the fried oysters , and some bbq wings .
0 oysters were pretty good this far out in the desert .
0 so needless to say the parking sucks .
0 if i could give zero stars i absolutely would .
0 i do n't eat chowder so i assured him i did n't .
0 btw , chowder , according to my boyfriend was terrible .
0 i asked them to remove the steak as i was done .
0 probably one of the worst restaurant experiences i 've ever had .
0 once the bouncers hand was washed off his cut was clearly not a bite .
0 if you tell anyone about what happened you 're not allowed back here .
0 i just can not say too many good things about this place .
0 it is busy all the time though so someone likes it .
0 looking back it has been here for at least _num_ years .
0 oyster house , i would not trust eating seafood here my friend .
0 just an old place that people like to drink at .
0 nothing to really brag about .
0 place is old and had a funky smell when you walk inside .
0 i would say this is more a local watering hole then a restaurant .
0 there are better places to go then here for oysters and other food .
0 it was my bad that i did n't count when i took it .
0 the hubs and i had to try this place passed it several times .
0 had the oysters , calamari , halibut and ahi .
0 i 'm not a cat person and having them near food is unsanitary !
0 i wo n't go back since there are plenty of places with decent staff .
0 but the servers are not all that friendly .
0 i 'm hoping next time i come i 'll have a better experience .
0 the service was horrific .
0 honestly if the wings were n't so good i would n't go back .
0 the tables outside seemed dirty and the service was mediocre .
0 wo n't go back .
0 wish it had been my choice !
0 would we go back , i only know i would n't .
0 this review is long overdue .
0 maybe i 'm getting too old for this , but seriously ... .
0 my husband finished off the rest .
0 but this is my review , not his , so two it is .
0 i wo n't be back .
0 management says bartender made a `` judgement call '' .
0 skip this place and spend your hard earned bucks somewhere else .
0 _num_ minutes to get our two orders of oyster rockefeller .
0 however , food was comped because we complained .
0 literally the worst place i have ever eaten in my entire life .
0 i did n't know that a restaurant could serve dog meat in america .
0 i would not wish this hole on an enemy .
0 at least the kids linguine soaked in vegetable oil will shoot through them quickly .
0 on the bright side our waitress only visited our table three times .
0 next , he ignored us and sat down watching the game .
0 wow , ate there the other day with my family and was very disappointed .
0 tough & way too fatty .
0 really disappointed in this place .
0 complete joke and very unprofessional .
0 this place goes to show you that crooks wo n't stay in business long .
0 i 'm glad i trusted my gut on this one .
0 we tried to , the pro was a jerk and service was terrible .
0 the course was in decent shape for the price paid .
0 however , the service is lacking every time i come here .
0 me know what was wrong .
0 and i could wait in there lobby .
0 after driving for _num_ miles , the problem still remained with absolutely no improvement .
0 nick also gave us all of the old parts that he had replaced .
0 do n't take your car here .
0 stop raising our rates you douche bags .
0 they charge an initial $ _num_ deposit .
0 seriously , they are not business friendly .
0 why can you not pay their overpriced bills with a credit card .
0 why do we not have another choice for our electric ?
0 another $ _num_ deposit !
0 my pool pump does n't go on until 9:00 pm .
0 i do n't cook inside in the summer .
0 only after 8:00 pm , even on the weekends .
0 this is beyond ridiculous !
0 we tried it for _num_ month and switched back to basic .
0 but i guess they do n't base it off of your credit .
0 unfortunately , they have repeatedly let me down .
0 needless to say , this ruined my appetite .
0 _num_ years ago i joined az cu as a student and got screwed over .
0 i once got $ _num_ out of the atm to pay for food .
0 i complained and got nowhere with their unfriendly customer service .
0 i was disappointed on all _num_ counts .
0 throughout my mortgage application process , i was promised a _num_ % interest rate .
0 the site kept showing _num_ % for days or weeks afterwards .
0 the customer service is terrible and their atm never works right .
0 i would give them a _num_ star if i could .
0 worst company i have worked with since i have had my business .
0 she demanded the $ _num_ to cancel the contract .
0 that is a $ _num_ product .
0 do not trust them with access to your account .
0 as a small business they have almost ruined me .
0 if i could give this company _num_ stars , i would .
0 do not trust them with your financial information .
0 i 'm a small business and they totally ruined me .
0 the tacos i got literally looked like the ones at jack in the box .
0 it was a week day during the lunch hours .
0 poor food and even worse service .
0 this is not real mexican food .
0 the beans were good but the concept was not understood .
0 everything else was bland .
0 a little over priced too .
0 i doubt i 'll be back .
0 nothing is authentic here , too much cheese , beans and not much flavor .
0 i was even more confused .
0 needless to say , i will not be back .
0 another five to six minutes go by .
0 it 'll be awhile before i come back to this location again .
0 he said the veggies were so greasy he could n't eat them .
0 a tv dinner would have tasted fresher .
0 now , sadly we cross off yet another mexican restaurant here in tempe .
0 no one near us knows how to cook fajitas .
0 unfortunately it is about an hour drive from our house .
0 wish i had better news for you people craving some good mexican food .
0 that is no excuse .
0 at this rate , another valley landmark might soon be going away .
0 we ate there and the food went downhill too .
0 mediocre food ... i can cook that at home !
0 i 've eaten here at least _num_ times in the past _num_ years .
0 i was not impressed with this place .
0 water and tea has a musty taste .
0 salsa was too chunky .
0 i was a customer for over _num_ years until december 9th .
0 i order the same thing every time .
0 the mini appetizer substitute fundido instead of guacamole .
0 apparently at this location that is n't allowed .
0 a side of fundido is $ _num_ they say .
0 does n't make sense .
0 do n't waste your time .
0 this is not really a mexican restaurant .
0 even the guacamole did not taste right .
0 my chips were never refilled i had to ask .
0 i wo n't be back .
0 salsa does n't have a bite so to me it 's lacking .
0 beverage delivery to our table was super slow .

0 mexican veggies side and black beans had cheese all over them .
0 service was n't what i would have expected .
0 my son is particular about his food as he is _num_ .

0 so my mom and i left and ate somewhere else .
0 could he bend a rule for a _num_ year old ?
0 i felt very disappointed in the customer service of the manager .
0 i was very disappointed .
0 i understand that the staff is short , they are looking to hire .
0 water , chips , salsa , etc .
0 but , our service was not good at all .
0 we made the mistake in sitting in the cantina though .
0 the worst human i 've encountered in at least _num_ years .
0 offensive , tacky , and unprofessional .
0 wo n't be back to this one .
0 my daughter did n't get her food even started until we got ours .
0 when we asked for the manager she came and removed the cold food .
0 the food is great but it 's a shame the management is so terrible .
0 immediately we asked to see a manager and tammy ignored our request .
0 what tammy did tonight at our table was highly illegal .
0 legal action will be taken if not addressed or ignored .
0 not a good experience with management .
0 manager made me feel like she was doing me a one time favor .
0 could have been avoided all together if the serving staff knew the menu better .
0 bad drivers , too fast and out of control .
0 messy store , dirty , sticky counters .
0 overhead music playing and a radio playing different music loud .
0 lets start with the poor customer service .
0 even when they have the staff to take care of it .
0 the floor in the fountain area is always dirty too .
0 have to agree ; probably the worst place for `` seafood '' around .
0 talk about annoying - the wait staff , especially .
0 no , it 's not the service .
0 i guess eating mediocre food in peace is n't good enough .
0 that 's your warning .
0 the food is n't that much better , either .
0 instead of a headache , you get to walk away with an upset stomach .
0 so , why _num_ stars ?
0 the waitress recommended sam adam 's oktoberfest instead .
0 what i would n't give right now for another pint of oktoberfest .
0 the crunchy fish sandwich is usually served with cheese .
0 i asked for mine without , but regretted it immediately .
0 save your time and money and avoid this place !
0 if you 're looking for seafood , go to the salt cellar .
0 at least there , you 'll get what you pay for .
0 ( not to mention the blue dye they have in their fake pond outside .
0 what the hell is that about ? )
0 i will never go to this horrid place again .
0 i was sick for two days after eating here .
0 the decor is the only thing this place had in common with it .
0 did n't like the taste of the broccoli .
0 i 'm kinda bummed that this place lived up to the bad reviews .
0 the hosts seemed to have no clue what they were doing .
0 they seated tables that were obviously still dirty which was gross .
0 i wish the experience was better than it was .
0 unfortunately i probably wo n't go back here .
0 looking around , there did n't seem to be a server in our area .
0 waiting waiting waiting again .
0 in all , not a positive experience .
0 my girlfriend 's salad was more dressing than anything else .
0 the food was so-so , but the service was dismal .
0 i will never return to this restaurant .
0 i decided to return again and ordered the crab cakes , big mistake .
0 they exchanged them for some fired shrimp but the damage had been done .
0 things seem to have really gone downhill since then .
0 the food and the service at this `` restaurant '' are equally terrible .
0 this did n't even include ordering food , much less getting it .
0 the food is very bland .
0 i 've tried this place a few times , that was my last time .

0 i ate the shrimp alfredo and my boyfriend had a burger .
0 and the food is better and a lot less expensive .
0 i 've been to other joe 's crab shack 's that were much better .

0 not only that , but i had to keep asking the waiter for refills .
0 tried this place with the little one after a visit to the mall .
0 we were both very disappointed .
0 the food was absolutely terrible .
0 neither of us could eat more than a few bites and then we left .
0 this place in general is a little too cheesy for me .
0 they offer mediocre seafood with over the top waitstaff .
0 it is almost like you are buying a used car .
0 the food itself is just ok .
0 nothing to write home about .
0 cody forgot my chowder and didnt apologize .

0 the soup came out the first time cold -- ok , that is understandable .
0 `` ) , once again , the soup was cold .
0 no visit from the manager ?
0 the place was very loud .
0 over all , over priced and loud .

0 we were seated by a table of about _num_ , _num_ were children .
0 the worst experience i have ever had after spending a $ _num_ .
0 my wife ordered the queen crab pot with a garlic butter sauce .
0 service overall was very slow .
0 the meals , save for the crab legs , were generally over salted .
0 the stuffed shrimp were ... .
0 that 's the only way to describe it .
0 the tartar sauce they gave me may as well have been mayonnaise .
0 the reason for my _num_ stars is because of the service .
0 i 'll get my seafood fix somewhere else .
0 food was poorly cooked and greasy and way overpriced .
0 we will never go to joes crab shack again .
0 slow service mediocre to lousy food .
0 will not be back .
0 one star just for the hospitality , _num_ $ for four pounds !
0 i absolutely love joes but not this location and here 's why .

0 the place was so noisy we could n't hear each other talk .
0 the skillet paella dish has been removed .
0 _num_ % + was breading .
0 the calamari was too large and rubbery .
0 not small and tender .
0 should have gone to pollo loco in the arizona mills shopping center .
0 the problem was with the menu .
0 crab cake was extremely salty .
0 not a good experience with the exception of our server matt .
0 they kept picking up the phone and just hanging up .
0 guess you 're too busy for these customers because we will never be returning .
0 my husband and i both became ill after eating here .
0 very disappointed , next time i 'll go to red lobster !
0 this was a horrible experience from beginning to end .
0 but , it gets worse from there .
0 recall , if you will , the place was almost empty .
0 the crab cake was cold in the middle .
0 the fried fish and onion rings tasted like old grease .
0 there was almost no fish inside the greasy batter .
0 the only thing that was good was the french fries .
0 i hardly ate anything on the plate .
0 then the waiter came out to bring out drinks and his hand was bleeding .
0 it was just an overall bad experience .
0 it seems like our experience gets worse the more we visit .
0 crab was overcooked too .
0 and finally , our bill was wrong .

0 however , it 's been more than _num_ years since my last visit .
0 my husband had never even heard of them , let alone dined there .
0 for me , when i walked in , it was just like old times .
0 the bright side is he brought out our drinks correctly .
0 and this is where the problems came about .
0 however , the manager 's responses were great .
0 for my husband , not so much .
0 my husband would have given it one star because of the entire experience .
0 we came late , on a saturday night , and were quickly seated .

0 mmmm ... cardboard parmesan .
0 seriously , it was gross .
0 it came with a side of spaghetti , which was all right .
0 not as gross as the eggplant , but still not good .
0 bad service , bad food .
0 the eggplant parmesan was paper thin and extremely over fried .
0 the drinks were weak .
0 the meal was one of the worst i have had in ages .
0 hands down , i will not be returning .
0 i would hate to see the place with the lights on !
0 even the service was only fair .
0 do n't waste your time or money !
0 do n't eat here .
0 they tasted like watered down coke .
0 maybe it was the _num_ yr old bartender .
0 the pizza was just ok , far from amazing .
0 i adore cats , but not in restaurants .

0 i will not be going back and urge you to support another local establishment .
0 this restaurant deserves no stars .
0 the second was there was not a server in sight .

0 cheese and sauce were some odd orange color with a awful taste .
0 i threw this pizza out the next day .
0 she said no , and that no one else had complained .
0 the owner came over and questioned me .
0 i mean , they were n't going to give me fresh beer ?
0 sorry guys , definitely lost this customer .
0 i wo n't be back .
0 the house salad is really poor .
0 when i went there the other day the service was really terrible .
0 my wife got the wrong dressing but ate it anyway .
0 we continued to dessert despite my better judgement .
0 forty dollars and tip for a meal this bad is ridiculous !
0 all i can imagine is the place is paying you to post on yelp .
0 and a boston bar , no less .
0 it 's a little expensive for a dive bar too .
0 there 's too many other bars within a block to waste time there .
0 the food is only okay and you can only get beer and wine here .
0 i struggled to find any flavor at all in the pizza .
0 crust was very tasteless .
0 got a caprese , tomatoes were hard and pink .
0 that is just flat out nuts .
0 pizza was great but the worst customer service ever .
0 it was 9:30 by the time my pizza came .
0 the weak instant iced tea was priced at $ _num_ .
0 if these prices seem just a little high , its because they are !
0 however , the quality of the food was just ... ... ok .
0 the thin sliced sausage was alright , but not spectacular .
0 this place is overpriced and not very good .
0 crust is tough , toppings are minimal .
0 we were very disappointed with this place .

0 i tasted charcoal more than i did sausage .
0 she should have noticed the burnt pie , however .
0 in a bad way .
0 the vegetarian pizza , however , did n't look too appetizing .
0 the taste is where it all fell apart .
0 the wood burning oven taste was not there .
0 there was n't the smoky flavor you 'd expect .
0 or drove ten more miles and went to bianco .
0 embarrassed to walk out i gave it a try to see if any good .
0 ordered a margarita pizza for it was cheapest .
0 what i got was a cheese sprinkled with basil and that was it .
0 at any rate the pizza was plain and a little dry .
0 also there was no wood oven taste .
0 not worth it and was not very good .
0 the worst pizza ever .
0 pizza dough isnt supposed to taste like wonder bread , all doughy & sweet .
0 this place is an insult to italian pizza .
0 there were _num_ strips of sausage , _num_ pepperoni slices and _num_ mushroom slices .
0 not a good start , to say the least .
0 after hearing the rave reviews from neighbors , i finally tried their pizza .
0 i thought it was ok , but nothing super special .
0 the crust was pathetic .
0 the cheese on the pizza was not bad .
0 i feel he did not cook it long enough for my taste .
0 i wo n't be going back .
0 plus their beer selection sucks .
0 i guess polish beer for the polish owner .
0 seriously though , polish beer in an italian pizza joint ?
0 then we split a spinach pizza .
0 another joke , limp pizza , tasteless and dry tasteless crust .
0 just not worth it , do n't waste your money there !

0 never ever ever decide to live here you will regret it .
0 worst experience as a tenant .
0 even the smallest of things !
0 the leaking continued so i had a second plumber come out at no charge .
0 note : no weekend or emergency service .
0 my refrigerator was n't working .
0 he did not give me a receipt .
0 when i realized that , i tried to catch him before he drove away .
0 unfortunately i found quite the opposite !
0 i could n't believe all the other yelp reviews are positive !
0 expensive service company - based on yelp review though to give a try .
0 for me their service charge , repair cost and cost to install was expensive .

0 so far , it has been quite the opposite .
0 no heat ( in december when it was _num_ degrees out ) .
0 kitchen sink clogged for two days .

0 i am convinced that they use the fake beef that taco bell does .
0 their burgers taste like salt and butter flavored pam to me .

0 it tasted like it was sitting out forever !
0 refused to refund us or do anything to remedy the situation .
0 you lost four customers today .
0 the pizza that was delivered were prepared horribly !
0 one pizza was overly cooked and had almost no cheese at all .
0 perhaps it is their business model , but the staff are rotating on deliveries .
0 they only seem to care about making their tips .
0 i was distracted and paid it without paying attention .
0 after last night i will never order from any domino 's again .
0 yet you offer no solutions .
0 this is an utter insult !
0 never in my life have i encountered a manager like that .
0 which was $ _num_ bill .
0 what a bummer , i was really looking forward to my pizza .
0 but they usually take that off the price for customer satisfaction .
0 the store itself is dirty on the outside , as well as the inside .
0 the produce section had flies all over the fruits and vegetables .

0 cathy finally said she would give me $ _num_ back .
0 however we moved to chandler and i had to cancel my membership .

0 i left this apartment spotless .
0 needless to say i was sure a mistake had been made .
0 very bad bee problem .

0 this is a huge , expensive and sad lesson i learned by living here .
0 do n't drop your rent at the office .
0 do n't send it certified , that 's not proof of payment .
0 sadly this is legal in arizona and they take advantage of it .
0 when a tree fell on my car , management did nothing to help !
0 a week later , we received another notice stating we still did n't pay .
0 when we found the correct location it was quite chaotic and disorganized .
0 we wo n't be back though .
0 i called the gym , they did not cancel my membership .
0 finally got to a live person that had no idea .

0 you have to wait in long lines .
0 as a matter of fact , there was probably one stain if any .
0 they will steel your money , take it from me .
0 someone else mentioned the birds .

0 from the beginning it was a nightmare .
0 it is not even worth calling them for .
0 i have had the absolute worst experience with this place .
0 worst apartment manager i 've ever dealt with .
0 they run all their loud equipment before sunrise .
0 then , last year , the water pump failed on the stream outside .
0 you tell mike , he makes excuses .
0 jordan ca n't be bothered but to consider her tenants as the enemy .
0 then , there are the tenants .
0 if you do not , they will pretend they did n't say it .
0 lastly , this place is seriously overpriced for what you get .
0 this place is awful in every way imaginable .
0 this is by far the worst apartment complex that i have ever lived in .

0 the wings were tasty , but had no sauce .
0 the beers were cheap , but it was like pulling teeth to order one .

0 the biggest problem is the overall appearance of the bar .
0 if the ambience were to be improved , this place would probably be packed .
0 the food took twice as long , again ... it was n't busy yet .
0 just imagine how long it took once they filled up the place .
0 the food is your average bar food , decently edible .
0 i would probably not go here again .

0 baseline sports bar is now a newly renovated bar called brick and barley .
0 never acknowledged us coming in or while we were sitting at the table waiting .

0 if i could give zero stars , i would .
0 second time not the charm .
0 asked for refund , refused .
0 was unacceptable and asked for them to be cleaned .
0 i would recommend finding somewhere else if you 're looking for quality work .
0 i was n't not happy about this .
0 very poor craftsmanship , very poor customer service .
0 they ruined an expensive pair of shoes !
0 i will never visit this place again .
0 customers needed help and they were n't approached .
0 she is sitting with me now writing this review and i love her .
0 very disappointing and he actually was not apologetic in the least .
0 they still have not responded to any of my emails .
0 so the woman put me on hold and suddenly a man ( owner ? )
0 delivery fee , plus another fee ?
0 anyway , i could tell he was in a big rush too .
0 i was disappointed in the pulled pork sandwich .
0 there was very little flavor and not enough sauce on it .
0 rib tips have no meat .
0 hot links , nasty .
0 she told me that their italian beef was popular .
0 that leads me to believe it was already made before i got it .
0 i think i also got some potato salad which was mediocre as well .
0 overall , the worst bbq place i 've been too .
0 i 'm not surprised because chicago people ca n't do anything right .
0 they screwed up pizza and the hot dog .
0 so i had the beef tips and chicken .
0 both heavily smoked and drowned in the same sauce .
0 beef and chicken ... two completely different animals , but both tasted identical .
0 the spicy sauce was bland and did n't have the slightest kick to it .
0 the beef tips were overcooked , tough and chewy .
0 the bone in the chicken was broken in two places and grossed me out .
0 everything else ended up in the trash .
0 i am sad to report i am not going back there to eat .
0 they just do not seem to care about the customer anymore .
0 i decided to give the place a second try after my last horrible experience .
0 i have been a customer for _num_ years , but now no more .
0 she really did n't look like someone who should be behind the counter .
0 the food was fast , but really no flavor .
0 the hot sauce was spicy , and the onion straws were over seasoned .
0 am looking for new bbq in phoenix .
0 and the guy at the counter was beyond rude to me when i ordered .
0 sad thing is is that i work in the same business complex as them .
0 i will no longer be going there for lunch .
0 their food is terrible !
0 as bad as the food is , their service is worse !
0 made the experience even worse .
0 i will definitely not be a repeat customer .
0 lunch special lacked ingredients shown in photo .
0 pickles were left out , though they were in the photo .
0 the french fries were the most god awful i 've ever had .
0 a dirty grease color , limp , soggy , and not even edible .
0 but this tom 's has a problem .
0 what could be so bad ?
0 what was underneath was small slices entirely from the fatty part of the brisket .
0 i walked in to find a small restaurant .
0 this italian beef was bland , they had the soggy part right .
0 the hot dog was even worse .
0 this was a giant sloppy mess of a hot dog .
0 then cucumber slices and practically no onion .
0 overall tom 's bbq was a big disappointment .
0 i 've had bbq in chicago and this place does n't come close .
0 the five underneath it were thin and dry .
0 the chicken and brisket were also dry as dust !
0 very poor food , unfortunately .
0 i 'm originally from illinois so of course i decided to try this establishment .
0 i had better luck down the street at subway .
0 do n't waste your time .
0 the taste , the vibe , the kindness just was n't there for us .
0 heck , the q was dry !
0 no amount of sauces can cover that up .
0 i doubt i 'll be going back .
0 the brisket here at tom 's was just ok .
0 these were very very dry and rubbery .
0 the pork was not mixed with the bbq like pulled pork normally is .
0 the corn was also disgusting .
0 the bbq beans were the only good factor of our meal .
0 have not eaten these yet .
0 but how can you mess up a hot dog ?
0 when i looked at this sandwich it was drowned in bbq sauce .
0 the pull pork did n't have any taste what so ever .
0 all i tasted was bbq sauce .
0 _num_ dollars for sandwich with no taste nor flavor it not worth my time .
0 wo n't go back .
0 horrible excuse for bbq .
0 ribs are flavorless , tough , and chewy .
0 sauce and sides are just as nasty .
0 $ _num_ for meat that should be fed to dogs .
0 i want to give it zero stars .
0 however , what really counts is the food ; which was awful .
0 i ordered the _num_ meat combo with chicken and ribs .
0 i can almost guarantee this meat has never seen the inside of a smoker .
0 furthermore , the sauce tastes like they picked it up at costco .
0 this place did not have that .
0 it was like we got the damn left overs .
0 overall , not going back .
0 no flavor , unless you count the kinda salty ketchup they call bbq sauce .
0 the only thing i can say is go to mcdonalds or any place else .
0 the food was terrible .
0 the french fries were so bad they went in the trash .
0 all you could taste was grease and bbq sauce .
0 one of the worst dinners i 've had in a long time .
0 i think the problem with tom 's bbq is they have loss their touch .
0 i am pulling for this place , i want to see it happen .
0 oh also the ladies room had a bad sewer smell .
0 the whole entire experience for me yesterday was a train wreck .
0 the staff seemed to not know what the hell they were doing .
0 but my stylist apparently did n't feel like using a dryer with me .
0 nothing , just awful customer care .
0 then i honestly was tired of being there .
0 every other time i visited this location , the staff provided great service .
0 i do n't remember my stylist 's name because she was n't very friendly .
0 she cut my hair and then talked about how my hair is super thin .
0 any idea to make me look like i have more hair i 'm thrilled .
0 i think it 's ugly and am just dying for it to grow back .
0 but never with me again .
0 the problem with this place is their drive-thru .
0 this is not one of those places .
0 customer service very poor !
0 i have been in the drive-through , two cars back for almost _num_ minutes .
0 kind of weird as the store seems empty .
0 this store is ghetto in comparison to other walgreens stores i have been in .
0 the store is not the cleanest in my honest opinion .
0 i wo n't go to this location unless i absolutely have to .
0 the inside is old and the employees clearly are n't happy to be there .
0 it came totally wrong .
0 i can not believe they let that thing out the door .
0 i just hated it .
0 that is not really a bread bowl .
0 me and one of my vegan co-workers ordered the southwestern salad , sans cheese .
0 when i finally saw the apartment , i felt like i had been had .
0 the paint was sloppy .
0 i 'm amazed none of them broke while i was cleaning .
0 lastly , their pet policy is pretty bad .
0 but all of this should have been done before moving anyone in !
0 i 'm angry , upset , and disgusted .
0 this place will mask anything to get your money .
0 there was no remodel , there was only a cover up .
0 spend your money elsewhere because it certainly is n't worth it here .
0 i felt and still feel so disrespected !
0 i signed a _num_ month less and i am miserable in this apartment !
0 my kids and i hate it here now .
0 either way i 'm screwed !
0 it 's extremely surprising there are no reviews on yelp for this place !
0 i basically left there feeling things crawl all over me .
0 i doubt the management company knows what 's going on .
0 the office does nothing .
0 everything i stated above is still accurate which is sad .
0 apparently no one had told him that we had moved in yet .
0 my husbands car was also broken into twice while living here .
0 do not move to this location .
0 my husband & i already regret moving here after _num_ month .
0 low grade features are not luxury .
0 nothing gets done when dogs bark at all hours .
0 the grounds are poorly kept and there are birds and bird poop everywhere .
0 you should expect to see cockroaches any and every where outside your apartment .
0 after living here a year , i would not recommend anyone to move here .
0 management is rude and unprofessional .
0 it is not worth it and there are much better places than here .
0 but unfortunately that 's about it .
0 there is a huge bug problem .
0 trust me spend the extra money you wont have to deal with .
0 let 's begin this list .
0 i have been here for _num_ months , and hate it .
0 the management is lazy , rude and do n't really care about their tenants .
0 why the heck is that ok ?
0 yet they change the dates _num_ times and do n't give updates .
0 they `` renovated '' the gym but it is horrible .
0 took away the mirrors and replaced the doors that 's it .
0 creepy neighbors that seem to be on drugs non stop .
0 the apartments have cheap carpet in them .
0 gilbert came back to our table and asked how _num_ a mo .
0 they can waste your time just as good as anyone else .
0 i would not purchase a vehicle from them or ever use there service .
0 i have purchased two cars from chapman , each with a negative experience .
0 i will never return to chapman chevy ever !
0 i was asked to sit in the waiting room ( no problem ) .
0 would rate their service department a _num_ if we could .
0 the next weekend i went back for the oil change .
0 they gave me an inspection report but did n't explain anything on it .
0 there were too many screw ups for this to have been an isolated incident .
0 i added the wheel and tire protection plan at an additional fee .
0 i got a flat tire last friday .
0 then he said yes , but they are all taken .
0 once again i said forget it and i will take my business elsewhere .
0 unfortunately he does not offer protection on the tire for future damage .
0 kudos to them for checking the car out again at no cost .
0 but we still do n't know for sure that the radiator replacement was necessary .
0 this just shows how terrible this dealership really is .
0 i took my car in a few different times for an oil change .
0 there 's just no follow up .
0 after i left , they kept on calling me and calling me .
0 i will never purchase from another chevy dealership again .
0 _num_ different stories , and one or both are lies .
0 unfortunately after making a couple phone calls to managers , they do n't care .
0 so , i call and make an appointment .
0 at this point i had been waiting for a little over _num_ hours .
0 should have probably done it myself at home .
0 pretty disappointed for my 1st visit .
0 service consultant was rude and condescending .
0 the guy treated his co-workers poorly as well .
0 in _num_ i ordered a truck from chapman chevrolet .
0 i have done business there for over _num_ years and am done now !
0 another staff member started yelling at him right in front of me .
0 and the worst of it was the two hour wait !
0 do i have to give them _num_ star ?
0 they do n't deserve it .
0 avoid any upcoming tent sales and chapman chevrolet .
0 i would not recommend anyone dealing with this company .
0 these people had to bring their vehicles back : ( such a bummer .
0 to get me into so they could a car sold .
0 i said no to the money any brought the car back .
0 so i get to go home without a car that i signed for .
0 worst customer service ever !
0 i got the feeling he could not care less .
0 - $ _num_ shop fee .
0 - unknown mystery fees that could not be explained .
0 i wish i would 've never dealt with this unorganized company .
0 scheduled a service appointment online , which was confirmed .
0 for _num_ minutes ... with nobody to help me .
0 total waste of my time.
0 eventually i just left .
0 um , why did i drive down there then ?
0 this has ruined my car buying experience completely .
0 i wish i had read these before buying my car here .
0 the bad reviews could n't be more accurate .
0 so many things wrong with this dealer .
0 expect to wait many hours for everything .
0 i ca n't imagine a dealer being any worse .
0 i was so irritated and frustrated !
0 but i will never spend my hard earned money at this establishment .
0 yes , the exact conditions described in the recall .
0 the power steering was working great , so long as the engine stayed on .
0 worst service rep ever .
0 after _num_ or _num_ minutes somebody directed me to this persons office .
0 now it is 11:30 and still no shuttle driver .
0 _num_ minutes later he called and said everything is ok it is ready .
0 if yelp allowed `` negative stars '' , i would use them .
0 sounds like jenny t & i had the same experience at chapman .
0 it lasted about _num_ months , when the same issue occurred again .
0 why on earth would we throw good money after bad on another gm product ?
0 finally , chapman called & said it was ready .
0 yep - you guessed it - did n't work .
0 we did n't even get out of the parking lot .
0 in addition , we are done buying gm .
0 no more chapman , no more gm .
0 i would not buy a car from here .
0 worst car service i 've ever had .
0 worst customer service ever .
0 oh hi hello i 'm sitting right here !
0 had two bad experiences with them more than _num_ years apart .
0 shoddy work and poor customer service .
0 horrible , shoddy , terrible work yet again .
0 i do n't usually write reviews , but these guys deserve this one .
0 nope just topped of the oil and gave it back .
0 will not be using this dealer again .
0 another thing is that i noticed that professionalism is not a thing here .
0 told me that would be $ _num_ .
0 this place is nothing but a joke .
0 please take this warning serious and buy your car somewhere else .
0 so i sit for another _num_ hours just to be told no .
0 they are worthless liars who like to waste your energy and time .
0 and i 'm sure in the long run thieves .
0 this dealer is a rip off !
0 if i could rate this _num_ stars i would .
0 my main issue here is the lack of integrity of this company .
0 they have completely lost my trust .
0 if that 's true , the management here really , really sucks .
0 even within warranty they asked for $ _num_ just to check what 's wrong !
0 i 'm done with chevy and seriously i will not touch another one .
0 i would never go back to this problem causing place ever again .
0 no i would not recommend this place nor a chevy .
0 next time i 'm bringing my attorney to buy a car .
0 its still a nice car but did n't get a deal in the end .
0 someone has to pay for the general managers gold and his obvious hefty appetite .
0 first time using the device department yesterday and it was not a good experience .
0 thus , i had to leave my car there all day .
0 second josh never called me all day to give me an update .
0 when i show up to get my car there is no one around .
0 they had it _num_ hours !
0 so i told him i wanted my car back .
0 worse experience by far at any company ever .
0 by the way this is my first yelp review i 've ever done .
0 we have multiple salesman in my family and they despise people like them .
0 everyone car shopping ever stay clear of chapman chevrolet .
0 ok she is being an ass .
0 everyone is in trouble because of this one car .
0 i do n't know how else to explain it to her .
0 again i apologize we where trying to work with you .
0 after years of using the quick service area , i will not be returning .
0 one gentleman was very helpful .
0 big name car deal ... you would think they would have integrity !
0 i wish that i could give them a zero .
0 you probably see where this is going .
0 chapman chevy just quoted me brakes for my truck for $ _num_ .
0 they came down to $ _num_ .
0 guess where i 'm going next week .
0 we were there and had the absolute worst experience of our lives .
0 he was very surprised emily told me i was pre approved .
0 tyler at chapman told me i needed new brakes and quoted $ _num_ .
0 i wo n't be back to chapman .
0 this dealership is the worst .
0 the first time was a joke and not one person asked to help me .
0 the girl told me the _num_ % would last thru the weekend .
0 so now i 'm waiting ... again ... for a _num_ % .
0 stay away from chapman chevy !
0 or they gave my number to companies that call me all the time .
0 i hate car sales company ethics .
0 just let me drive a car and get some value for it .
0 this was the worst experience of my life with a dealership .
0 worst experience ever would never bring a car back there again !
0 the way that the local dealership 's service dept handled it was sub par .
0 phone etiquette is terrible .
0 the only problem was that the cost of the repair was very high .
0 like , are you serious ?
0 not ready or available .
0 i dropped my vehicle off tuesday at 8am as scheduled .
0 this was not acceptable to me .
0 probably would not go back to buy or service any of my vehicles .
0 i just finished reviewing precision fleet services and they got a _num_ !
0 poor service all the way around .
0 he said i should leave the car there until they looked at it .
0 i explained i have no other car or a way to get around .
0 so after having my car about _num_ hours , they did nothing !
0 sadly , this dealership has serious integrity issues , and i will not return .
0 it was a good price for a fairly new used car with low mileage .
0 more than a month later , the car still smells .
0 we set an appt to drive two hours to see it the following saturday .
0 no wonder ppl love ford .
0 chapman chevrolet has decided to made very poor customer service decisions repeatedly .
0 they told me that the car was still not done .
0 really they chose an angry customer multiple times the past _num_ weeks .
0 by playing games with when they have totally ruined their reputation in my eyes .
0 the drive thru was packed , so i walked in .
0 there was a line _num_ people deep , and no one taking any orders .
0 just a quick update - this kfc shut down just a few weeks ago .
0 i guess it was a bad idea .
0 the food was old and lacked taste .
0 old chicken becomes very chewy and i just gave up without finishing my meal .
0 just stopped in the drive thru for a quick lunch .
0 i was given fries instead of the coleslaw i ordered .
0 the bun was burned and had dirty grill marks all over it .
0 a piece of fried chicken that had been sitting somewhere for awhile .
0 coleslaw was the only part that was any good .
0 i 've gone twice the past few months and it has been horrible .
0 this was not the kfc i use to know .
0 the food quality for the sandwich was terrible .
0 i feel ripped off .
0 terrible customer service , always out of chicken .
0 first off , bugs !
0 i went to this office once for my yearly exam .
0 needless to say i left the appointment in tears .
0 nice pool , terrible support and service after installation .
0 little to no instructions left on how to maintain pool after installation .
0 warranty issues are handled , but not without multiple calls .
0 they are disorganized and have very poor customer service .
0 furthermore , they could not find my third pair of shoes .
0 a week passed and he did not call me when he said he would .
0 they still had not located my shoes .
0 another week passed and again , i never got a call .
0 so , again , i called them .
0 that i was tired of waiting .
0 and i do n't pay attention to name brands .
0 i just buy what i like .
0 however i did know that i paid about $ _num_ for the shoes .
0 however , i was also upset at the way they handled the whole situation .
0 i would not recommend this business to anyone .
0 i arrive there and guy _num_ is not working .
0 so , guy _num_ tells me to come back again on tuesday .
0 i keep telling him , no , that he spoke with my hubby .
0 really , guy _num_ ?
0 his response was so curt and defensive that i was taken off guard .
0 at that point , i should 've taken my purse and left .
0 i told him that no sales tax is to be charged on labor .
0 he does n't deserve anybody 's business .
0 however , i will never use this service again .
0 no business skills at all .
0 like the other reviews had mentioned they are very disorganized , and completely rude .
0 its sad that people can actually run a business this way .
0 do not patronize this establishment .
0 the short jerk who took over is giving this place a bad name .
0 super rude and does crappy work .
0 i will never use their shoe repair services again .
0 both tips fell out before noon .
0 listen yelpers , this guy is rude and attempted to rip our shoes off !
0 rude and horrible customer service !
0 i have had them fix _num_ pairs of my shoes .
0 i am taking them elsewhere this time .
0 super rude and very unprofessional , never going back to him ever again !
0 wo n't see ya there .
0 this guy ruined a pair of my favorite shoes .
0 meanwhile , i am stuck with my favorite pair of shoes , ruined .
0 why did wayne have me drive all the way back ?
0 what a ridiculous waste of my time .
0 really disappointing service from a place i used to frequent .
0 i did not check the inside of the shoes .
0 for that reason , i wo n't be back .
0 could n't even look up my name .
0 rude about the entire thing , unpleasant , and unprofessional .
0 it took _num_ months to schedule first time appointment .
0 i get blonde highlights on top and the rest is a dark chocolate brown .
0 i came here for an eyebrow wax awhile back and was unimpressed .
0 i would not go back .
0 altered ego obviously has an altered sense of the word `` appointment '' .
0 she trimmed it again and proceeded to do the color .
0 never will i return again .
0 my first ( and last ) appointment with altered ego was yesterday .
0 i just want a haircut . ''
0 boy , was i wrong .
0 unfortunately , that punch line never came .
0 the whole experience was disappointing .
0 they 'll have nothing to do with you when you complain .
0 i was assured that would be no problem .
0 i will not be returning .
0 all this did was turn my roots gold .
0 however , i will not be returning .
0 i wasted my money .
0 i keep falling for high reviews and end up disappointed .
0 what was a perfect day was ruined by horrible customer service .
0 i was given a $ _num_ gift card at the bridal show .
0 i 'm escorted to the front desk and get prepared to pay .
0 i leave sit in my car and look at the gift card .
0 i was n't looking for the style to be free .
0 also do n't hand out fake gift cards that mean nothing !
0 which was fine , whatever .
0 get _num_ % off '' etc etc .
0 could n't reach anyone .
0 so now you lost me as a customer .
0 stop sending me emails that you want me back .
0 if you want to bake while you work out , this is the place .
0 only a/c turned on in the mornings , is in the weight area .
0 get your act together _num_ hour fitness !
0 thats kind of deceiving to potential new customers .
0 the old stuff is n't noticed as easily .
0 tempe is still the neglected one .
0 just joined this gym a week ago ... not impressed at all .
0 i know i would never recommend this gym to anyone else .
0 i 've been to quite a few _num_ hour fitness gyms .
0 yes , this has all the equipment you need for cardio and weights .
0 , and equipment is down for maintenance fairly regularly .
0 it 's literally stopped me from getting my morning swim in .
0 got a hassle every single time i 've tried to check in .
0 not going to tolerate it one more time .
0 equipment is old and is not well maintained .
0 at last count they only had _num_ out of _num_ bikes working .
0 locker room is dirty .
0 _num_ % of the showers do n't work .
0 soap dispenser was empty for _num_ days .
0 staff does not seem to care .
0 for many , many months prior , all the bikes were taken by 8:30 .
0 i wish this company would get their act together .
0 this gym is the worst i have encountered in terms of facility renovations needed .
0 why is my gym not open for _num_ hours ?
0 ok guys , i have been coming here for about _num_ months now .
0 equipment is old but works great .
0 i walked into the gym on march 30th to begin a life change .
0 how absurd is that ?
0 not my fault you 're money hungry because your sessions are ridiculously overpriced .
0 its kinda dingy and lacking equipment but is close to home .
0 he said he could cancel it but i would have to pay _num_ $ .
0 very disappointed with this gym .
0 this place is not clean and the front desk is not friendly whatsoever .
0 the _num_ or _num_ available all had out of order signs on them .
0 for a commercial gym this place is so poorly maintained !
0 it is not accurate to report this as closed .
0 i do not like this target .
0 expect less , pay more !
0 so it 's $ _num_ .
0 i wish there was a way to comment about the pharmacy alone .
0 it sure was great using the target pharmacy before they switched over .
0 there customer service i feel is not very good at all .
0 i would not recommend .
0 i tried repeatedly to contact the manager to no avail .
0 lack luster service here .
0 brought the pizza back and received the wrong pizza again .
0 warning -- they take no responsibility for their work .
0 absolutely the worst service i have ever seen .
0 avoid at all costs .
0 two weeks later i noticed oil stains in my garage where i park .
0 loved how they worked with me all the years ive gone to them .
0 made an appointment online at _num_ am for an oil change at _num_ am .
0 website said i would receive a phone call to verify my appointment .
0 they call me _num_ minutes later and tell me my truck is ready .
0 every other place does includes these services .
0 i checked my oil and it was clean .
0 he told me to come down and he would have it fixed .
0 i show up and craig was very helpful .
0 they have horrible customer service and have shady business practices .
0 overall horrible experience on all levels please save yourself the headache of coming here .
0 customer service is terrible .
0 they refused to replace the screw even though they were at fault again .
0 there is more , but i am tired of typing .
0 minimum _num_ minute wait for everything at this place .
0 i ended up driving back later and they immediately put it back in .
0 rates here seem higher than other places .
0 they quoted me almost $ _num_ .
0 i had all _num_ tires replaced here .
0 i checked it and they did not put in enough oil .
0 i 'm full and disappointed .
0 i ordered shrimp egg foo young and crispy orange tofu .
0 it was not hot or spicy as the menu indicated .
0 there 's was n't anything promising about the meal .
0 the worst is this : they use styrofoam for everything .
0 makes me sick to my stomach .
0 i am tempted to give them _num_ star for this reason .
0 this was god awful .
0 the chicken was fat with some skin and flavorless sauce .
0 somehow , they messed up the rice too .
0 but , really , do n't .
0 no idea how this has such good reviews .
0 the rice was dry .
0 the chicken with broccoli was bland and way too creamy .
0 wo n't be ordering from here again .
0 i was going between it and another place -- what a mistake .
0 i ordered sweet and sour chicken and moo shu veggies .
0 i 'm not kidding , actual tortillas .
0 the quality of the chicken was the worst .
0 it was a waste of _num_ bucks !
0 edible , but not good at all .
0 egg foo young -- overwhelmingly garlicky .
0 but , not finding a menu online , we went with this place .
0 big , $ _num_ , mistake .
0 but one item can not really do the trick .
0 but sometimes i would get different containers .
0 a large would be a med , and med would be a small .
0 some days i had left overs , others i was still pretty hungry .
0 compared to other us cities , this place ranks very low in my book .
0 so you can imagine our disappointment .
0 the chunks were sparse , to say the least .
0 moving on to the fried rice : i have never tasted anything so bland .
0 maybe the crab puff would be good ?
0 the last attempt to find something edible was the egg roll .
0 the sweet and sour chicken is hit and miss .
0 when its good it 's tasty but when it 's bad it 's terrible .
0 the eggs rolls had a tolerable texture but were almost bitter in taste .
0 after waiting for over an hour for delivery this meal was terribly disappointing !
0 probably wo n't be back , bummer .
0 i was totally wrong ... .
0 the veggies were blah ... .
0 the crab puffs were soggy and the egg rolls ... .
0 they were horrible ... !
0 the worst egg rolls i ever ate in my life ... .
0 the rice was dry and disgusting ... .
0 this is my second order , and by accident .
0 and chicken and veg for myself as i only eat chicken fish and turkey .
0 the food was bland , dry and luke warm .
0 the fried rice is the worst i ever tasted .
0 salty , and dry .
0 she offered to refund my money forty min ago .
0 if you 're thinking about placing an order , do n't waste your money .
0 ok they delivered my refund .
0 but not before i received my two subs from jimmy johns .
0 it was n't at all good or even remotely satisfying .
0 even the chinese place i go to while im baked is better .
0 the food was bad too .
0 as late night i mean baked the fuck out of your head .
0 thankfully , tempe has an abundance of chinese food outlets ; goodbye !
0 she was a little rude but i dealt with it .
0 got the orange chicken , hunan beef , and chicken chow mien .
0 the orange chicken was the worst i 've ever had .
0 not crispy or breaded .
0 really , all of it sucked except the rice .
0 but i ate it .
0 egg rolls were okay and the crab puffs were great but tiny .
0 there is too much breading on their `` crispy '' teriyaki chicken .
0 i ordered sweet and sour chicken , and he ordered crunchy chicken teriyaki .
0 both came with fried rice , an eggroll and a crab puff .
0 we did n't really like any of it .
0 this place was n't very good .
0 hot and sour soup tasted off .
0 eggroll did n't taste good .
0 hope i do n't get sick !
0 fortune cookies were good .
0 they seem nice enough but the food is bad even by take out standards .
0 my chicken was over salted and so much mushy breading .
0 the portion is unbelievably small , chicken is dry .
0 _num_ of them got sick and most of the food was thrown out .
0 i 've given this place _num_ chances .
0 the prices are too high and the food is bland .
0 my usual place does n't deliver so i decided to try their food .
0 it tasted off and the ingredients were mushy .
0 it took forever and they gave me moldy chicken .
0 they 're not very express and give you no chopsticks !
0 i probably wo n't order from them again .
0 okay why not ! ''
0 i chose orange chicken , sweet and sour pork , and chicken chow mien .
0 delivery guy was friendly and all went well until i checked out the food .
0 it was edible , but not what i was really craving .
0 the fried rice is white rice with a sauce .
0 egg rolls were good but a little mushy .
0 overall , i would probably never order from here again .
0 wonton soup looked and tasted like dirty dish water .
0 id give it negative stars if i could .
0 it was bland and horrible texture .
0 their fried rice equally bland .
0 chow mein however did pack a punch of garlic flavor .
0 i really liked that they delivered quickly , which was a plus .
0 next time i 'm in town , i 'll order elsewhere .
0 i ca n't believe i 'm considered a regular here .
0 service is lame to pathetic .
0 and there is rita 's too .
0 i ordered the pumpkin pie blizzard and it was horrible .
0 ended up throwing it away in the trash .
0 i was not impressed by this dairy queen .
0 when we asked how long , we were told _num_ mins .
0 by the time his food came , i was done with my ice cream .
0 the hamburger was not that great .
0 i do n't know why i keep going back here for waxing or nails .
0 i will not go to this place anymore .
0 i made a yelp account as i wait for my food at this place .
0 she said it would be _num_ minutes wait for it .
0 damn my craving for fried chicken .
0 the staff is always very impersonal and act put out to serve you .
0 today 's meal was not very good .
0 the chicken was too dry and cooked too long .
0 worse the employees do n't wash their hands after using the rest room .
0 worst customer service ever .
0 they do n't even deserve _num_ star .
0 the girls there are not friendly .
0 and if you ask to have a fresh one made they noticeably seem annoyed .
0 on a whim i stopped here for some chicken .
0 sorry , not coming back here !
0 of chicken i 'm not ever coming back .
0 pretty disgusted and wo n't be going back to this location .
0 _num_ min later he yelled across the bar that our food was ready .
0 this is honestly the worst service i have ever had .
0 i will not be back .
0 this place has really gone downhill .
0 we used to live nearby , and came here regularly for karaoke .
0 avoid this place , there are better bars not far away .
0 i will never step foot back into this place .
0 i wish i could give them zero stars .
0 my friends and i went here last night wanting to do some karaoke .
0 next time do n't make me chase you down . ''
0 ummm , excuse me !
0 this was so disrespectful the way she talked to me as a new customer .
0 there obviously will not be a `` next time . ''
0 it was n't even busy so sucks for them to lose out on customers .
0 it reeked of urine so bad we did n't even bother sitting down !
0 awful , awful smell .
0 this was hands down the worst business i have visited in _num_ .
0 did n't even make it past the phone call .
0 do n't waste your time .
0 that was enough to turn me away permanently .
0 i do n't want to do business with people who treat employees like that .
0 bottom line , there are better , less expensive options out there .
0 the staff moving in was horrendous .
0 the staff now is so green one can not even reason with them .
0 for the money you 'll spend here one can get so much more .
0 run , do n't walk , from this complex .
0 the people suck and do not care about residents .
0 they charge ridiculous fees when they are the ones who made the mistake .
0 i wish i had never agreed to a yr at this place .
0 i lived here for one year and that was way too long .
0 this place is not pet friendly .
0 do not live here !
0 that 's not our fault !
0 i wish i had listened to the other reviewers .
0 do n't make the mistake of living here .
0 if you are in any kind of hurry do n't go here .
0 the drive through is soooooo slow .
0 everyone loves starbucks , but sadly at this location has terrible customer service .
0 i walked in , no welcome or anything like everyone usually gets .
0 i 'm not one to complain about it being too cold , but seriously .
0 the beverage literally took me less than a couple of minutes to finish .
0 i definitely feel like i wasted my money here .
0 i have never really been impressed with trader joes .
0 i find them to be over priced and lacking variety .
0 i guess i might be happier if i were a meat eater .
0 i am a vegetarian , who even when i ate meat , hated fish .
0 what , how weird ... i 'm used to seeing the nuts but fish ?
0 wish i could give it no stars .
0 the last time i shopped there was the last straw .
0 the clerk said and did nothing .
0 and that was the last time trader joe 's got any of my money .
0 their brussel sprouts ( on the stock ) gave me food poisoning .
0 i was very sick for _num_ days .
0 never will i buy any fresh veggies from them again .
0 whoa trader joe 's .
0 so i went in thinking they actually make these things from scratch .
0 she went and get the _num_ yr old baker .
0 if you read this review , please also read nathan 's comment below .
0 however , the new management sucks .
0 apparently the other baked goods like the scones , muffins , etc .
0 are from scratch , but the croissants themselves are not .
0 we walked in and it was relatively busy .
0 there was enough to really gross me out .
0 the bacon was pretty rubbery - probably because they microwave everything .
0 the croissants were decent , but there was nothing particularly special about them .
0 that does n't mean they wo n't be delicious !
0 the hubs got himself a chocolate bavarian cream croissant .
0 i was sorely disappointed !
0 i mean , this was some really , really old jelly .
0 the hub 's choice was not much better .
0 that is not their problem .
0 whatever you do , do not order a breakfast sandwich .
0 it does n't taste good and it 's not healthy .
0 they need to focus on making better breakfast food to compliment the croissants .
0 then i went to day and more then likely will never go back !
0 it was not flaky at all and very little taste .
0 not at all like i had remembered them to be .
0 not even close to what a croissant should taste like .
0 the vegetables with the egg and cheese were cold as well .
0 what a waste of time .
0 so i just quickly ordered one and paid .
0 she then threw my quiche in a microwave .
0 are n't you a bakery ?
0 seriously ... what is wrong with this bakery ?
0 they microwave their food and the staff is awful .
0 wo n't come here again .
0 i 've tried going back several times over the last few years .
0 so why go to a place that blows off your order ?
0 i do n't normally write bad , but holy poop !
0 next time will go get a crepe next door .
0 very over priced and quality is way down from childhood days !
0 it 's just unfortunate that they are next to a fantastic french restaurant .
0 it just does not compare and the croissants are ok .
0 not even service could save them ... .
0 i dont understand a restaurant that always runs out of food before lunch time .
0 the veggies were what really got my goat though .
0 the menu says the sandwich comes with bell pepper , onion , and mushroom .
0 there was more egg than anything .
0 not to mention all the people that have handled it without washing their hands .
0 so , long story short , we will not be returning .
0 like the third time i 've been here and they are out of croissants .
0 kind of disappointing that you drive over and they are always sold out .
0 that croissant was more like bread .
0 it was not flakey , airy , buttery .
0 even the almond flavor was off .
0 what arrived was the chocolate chip filled one .
0 went in to see croissants that appeared about 1/3 smaller and almost flat .
0 do n't think i 'd ever have a reason to go back .
0 i ordered a croissant with no veggies sausage and cheese iced chai latte .
0 no big deal it happens i 'm sure they used bagged ice .
0 wo n't be back .
0 they microwaved my croissant on a styrofoam plate .
0 i will not eat food microwaved on styrofoam .
0 however , he did n't know how to blend coffee .
0 he told me that once it melts , i could drink it .
0 you are better off eating at a panda express in the projects .
0 it had veggies , chicken , pork and shrimp .
0 i would go again if invited , but not by choice .
0 maintenance was called each time and the phone was shut off .
0 finally they responded and said they would fix it while i was at work .
0 neither of the dishes were really that great .
0 maybe i 'm biased but this place is just okay .
0 my boyfriend and i decided to get some takeout tonight from them .
0 mine was plain terrible .
0 literally no flavor or spice in fact .
0 ben got chicken fried rice , and the pan fried shrimp .
0 he said the fried rice was terrible , shrimp was average .
0 steamed rice was kinda crunchy , just your average quick cook rice .
0 what a hot mess that was .
0 not in a good way .
0 there was no flavor .
0 she did n't know what to make of it .
0 i felt bad for recommending it .
0 it was such a let down .
0 i said no and drove off .
0 had take-out from here tonight while visiting family in tempe .
0 it just was n't anything to write home about .
0 i was a former wong 's fan .
0 none of them were great .
0 i 'm not really sure that i like wong 's place .
0 the egg drop soup came back and it was okay .
0 so i asked for wonton instead .
0 both times i had wong jo chicken as a lunch special .
0 i was n't really feeling it on my second visit .
0 i tasted most everyone 's entrees and was n't really all that impressed .
0 the accompanying photo is of the wong jo chicken from my first visit .
0 i 'm not really feeling wong 's place .
0 again , very awkward .
0 i guess i wo n't be coming back .
0 the spare ribs were awful and nothing at all like chinese pork !
0 i really think panda express is a lot better than this .
0 no big deal it was n't in my food .
0 i am sorry to say i still have a hard time with rice .
0 but not from this place .
0 it is much too bad because i loved this place .
0 wong 's chicken was not crisp .
0 the dumplings were under cooked .
0 the singapore noodles were n't bad and they were n't great either .
0 not enough curry or spice oils , so not enough heat .
0 by comparison , wong 's jr .
0 the food is basically flavor less and the meat quality is sub par .
0 i wo n't recommend it .
0 no wonder people will think chinese food is very unhealthy .
0 the food is really bad .
0 food was horrible for all _num_ guests in our party .
0 everything was served cold and had clearly been reheated .
0 not even remotely fresh .
0 server did not listen to anything we said as we ordered and seemed irritated .
0 i love to support small businesses but this was a really bad meal .
0 why take orders only to cancel .
0 what a lousy way to handle paying customers !
0 probably some of the worse chinese food i have had .
0 ordered the house chicken since it seemed to be a favorite by the reviews .
0 the chicken was plain and sauce tasted like sweet burnt garbage .
0 ate maybe five bites then threw the rest out .
0 it would be nice if info was shared that they are closed !
0 had their buffet _num_ years ago .
0 tables were greasy , floors were dirty .
0 unless their management has changed since then , i will not go back .
0 it does not even deserve the one star .
0 the place was mess .
0 one of the potstickers i had tasted like it was made with rotten meat .
0 the hot and sour soup was awful .
0 please save yourselves the trouble and eat somewhere else .
0 this is the worst chinese food i 've ever had .
0 i repeat , the worst ever .
0 the food was oily and flavorless and the selections were limited and mostly breaded .
0 instead , i was stuck with dry tilapia and flavorless salmon .
0 how can anyone f up such a standard dish ?
0 i imagine it probably tasted full of chemicals , too .
0 run , do n't walk away from this place .
0 panda express is a five-star restaurant compared to this place .
0 as i said before : run , do n't walk away from this place !
0 the food was sub-par and cheap .
0 i will not eat at this establishment again .
0 many familiar choices ( if you 've been to a chinese buffet before .
0 mostly , i 'd say this was due to the lack of customers .
0 i was also not overly impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant .
0 as a chinese buffet , i 've had both better and worse .
0 i would consider going back , but it would n't be my first choice .
0 will not be going back .
0 have no idea why my dad picked this place for his bday .
0 i can see some of it was raw seafood , not too good .
0 i would give it zero stars if i could .
0 after paying , we were seated and the table was filthy .
0 we got up and demanded our money back .
0 then they tried to keep the money for the sodas .
0 this is where we always go and where we should have gone that night .
0 the register person asked me for $ _num_ when i stepped up .
0 california roll looked ok , though old as the avocado had turned black .
0 he replied `` no english '' .
0 heat for lo mein on arrival at the table was lukewarm .
0 wasabi was probably not fresh , certainly not hot .
0 there was no way i could continue .
0 she just told him to sit on the other side .
0 i waited a 1/2 hr still no crab legs .
0 food was not very good and tables dirty .
0 sadly , they would have a better review years ago .
0 this was not a surprise .
0 some were even empty .
0 i just about fell out my seat .
0 food was cold , it was bland and i would never go here again .
0 it was filthy dirty .
0 so so so gross .
0 however , the condition of the place is my issue .
0 there were way too many kids running , literally , back and forth .
0 ate here last night for the first time .
0 wo n't go back .
0 i tried the sushi and regretted it immediately .
0 i was thankful i did n't get sick .
0 you would be better off going to panda express .
0 i will not be returning .
0 first off , the place was dirty .
0 the food was `` okay '' , nothing special .
0 i do n't even want to give one star !
0 services bad , restroom was so nasty !
0 this was our first and last visit to this restaurant .
0 which i could give this place no stars because this is disgusting .
0 place has no pride of ownership .
0 ripped seats , sticky floors , food has little to no flavor .
0 do i want to sit in a ripped seat ?
0 am i that desperate for your food ?
0 these guys have no clue .
0 smh food wasnt all that .
0 i barely finished my first plate .
0 this place has gone bad .
0 do not eat this !
0 the pizza was a request from a customer i was trying to impress .
0 i would not order from this location again .
0 the pizza delivered was not what i ordered .
0 a greasy pool of tiny chicken nuggets .
0 not at all what i ordered .
0 ok , first off i love pizza hut pizza .
0 i 'm still waiting for a pizza i ordered _num_ mins ago .
0 do n't get delivery from here .
0 if u do do n't tip .
0 are you kidding me ?
0 awful service and worse staff .
0 the worst dining experience i have had in over _num_ years .
0 the manager had no control over the staff or the experience to manage anyone !
0 i 'm grabbing lunch with my boyfriend and we pulled up to this location .
0 chicken was not great seemed to be sitting to long .
0 wo n't come to this location again .
0 getting it wrong from what i read is there specialty .
0 music going but no one home .
0 this shit is awful .
0 i feel bad that this company represents louisiana in any culinary form .
0 also , learn to fucking count .
0 yet again , cold and flavorless .
0 in short , i wo n't be going back here .
0 this place is the absolute worst at customer service & speed .
0 this place was awful .
0 the soda was flat , the mashed potatoes were a disgrace .
0 the best part was the buttery biscuit and the cajun fries .
0 thoroughly disappointed with the entire experience .
0 have n't been here in quite a while .
0 i was greeted by a friendly employee .
0 ace lost my business today .
0 too bad , i would love to support locally operated ace .
0 worst customer service i have ever received .
0 i guess they really do n't care about their honest customers and their concerns .
0 the first are _num_ cents each and the new ones are _num_ cents each .
0 so by all accounts a _num_ difference would be about _num_ cents .
0 her total $ _num_ .
0 if i could give less than _num_ star i would .
0 seriously i would not take a bug here if they were dying .
0 some of the staff rude .
0 dr would n't call .
0 i feel like this should have been an easy find from a vet .
0 will not be returning .
0 first off , most of the staff i met were very nice .
0 but the vet i ended up with was horrible .
0 my cat was drooling and i was scared that her teeth were bad .
0 she was just laying down on the counter .
0 they were pushing for me to get it scheduled immediately .
0 i left without scheduling an appointment and started cleaning my cats teeth at home .
0 they did n't even talk to me about her being slightly over weight .
0 soggy french fries fail .
0 how do you f up fries ?
0 `` no we do n't serve breakfast til _num_ am !
0 one of the worst quick lunches i 've ever had .
0 the burger was dry , the bacon was burnt , and the sauce .
0 not on my burger .
0 and this was not the the burger for that .
0 which was kinda on the flat side .
0 not my idea of a good burger joint for lunch .
0 just had to give our drive thru order _num_ times to the same person !
0 yes , _num_ times .
0 people behind the counter look at me like i 'm a problem .
0 i did n't even bother w the drive thru after that .
0 i 'm not picky .
0 those two condiments probably saved me from dying of food poisoning .
0 yelp , i can not think of the words necessary to express my disappointment .
0 why the hell would i want my fish shredded ?
0 on top of that the flavors were just bad .
0 it was either canned , or just not fresh .
0 why are they adding frozen veggies to the rice ?
0 it does n't bring me comfort to know they are n't cooking anything fresh .
0 for mexican food , and terrible mexican food at that !
0 it is an unbelievable little place .
0 i could not believe it !
0 i will not be back !
0 this place does not even compare .
0 a total rip off !
0 ate here last week with a friend she liked her lava bowl of soup .
0 i had fish tacos that you could tell was frozen .
0 i wo n't be back .
0 this guy does n't provide the prescription as he 's not a doctor .
0 very poor customer service .
0 he did n't have a desk assistant , when i visited him .
0 i do n't trust this company and would n't recommend them to a friend .
0 if only yelp offered negative star ratings .
0 it turned out to be a terrible purchase .
0 really awful customer service .
0 battery chains are a dime a dozen .
0 is this radio shack even selling anything or is everyone constantly out to lunch ?
0 they do n't seem scheduled .
0 if they 're scheduled , change the hours of operation to reflect that .
0 _num_ stars on service , _num_ stars on availability .
0 edit : my girlfriend just pointed out the `` now hiring '' sign .
0 i had a tamale the first time and it was dry and oily .
0 so do n't go there unless you want terrible service .
0 my husband likes them , i do n't .
0 the place was not too busy .
0 the taco was just ok.
0 the chicken was tasty , and the lettuce was crisp .
0 there was a little cheese in there too .
0 the enchilada sauce had a burnt taste and was dark brown .
0 i 'm not an enchilada expert but i 've had better .
0 this cheese enchilada was flat and i could not taste any onions .
0 my husband and i ordered the tamale , taco combo plate with green chili .
0 there was no flavor at all in anything on the plate .
0 my husband had avoided this place because its name is so stupid .
0 not to mention it was lacking cheese .
0 also ordered a chicken chimichanga .
0 i wish los taquitos would have been open at this hour !
0 was i wrong ... .
0 you know , the kind you can get at all other normal mexican restaurants ?
0 we ask if we can put anything else in it and she says no .
0 i left full , but unhappy .
0 and they do n't even have carne asada , its ground beef .
0 it is really a miracle that they could made such boring mexican fare .
0 but the food certainly is not worth the visit .
0 if i wanted a large taco , i would have ordered a large taco .
0 i probably should have read some reviews before ordering .
0 i literally walked out without eating .
0 service was what you would expect from a burrito joint , nothing stellar .
0 should we talk about their beef / chicken ?
0 veggie burrito was just a bean and cheese .
0 this was a _num_ '' tortilla with cheese , sour cream and raw onion .
0 michelle answered and asked immediately if she could put me on hold .
0 _num_ minutes later , michelle picked up again and asked if i could hold .
0 i asked if the restaurant was busy and she replied that it was steady .
0 instead , i 'm a more die hard qdoba guy than ever .
0 i 'll pay more for quality , not to stick it to the man .
0 the service is horrible at this place !
0 it was really nothing special .
0 i should know better than to stray from america 's taco shop .
0 so i ordered the carne asada burrito .
0 maybe _num_ % carne asada .
0 but i only noticed from the texture .
0 sure did n't taste it .
0 but still only so so compared to what i am used to getting .
0 they were not particularly busy , maybe 10-15 % capacity .
0 no priority for to-go orders .
0 it ruined it for me .
0 my child , like most kids , will only eat very plain items .
0 definitely nothing special about this place .
0 in the end we wrote it off as a one time , bad day .
0 i can assume that is why that visit went off without a hitch .
0 it 's why i do n't eat at fast food restaurants often .
0 so if you peel the layers away its really not that big .
0 every thing tasted ok but didnt blow me away .
0 my boyfriend and i stopped by after hearing a lot of hype .
0 honestly , i would rather run through a filibertos .
0 we were there yesterday , we walked in , the place was a mess !
0 they asked _num_ times , yes _num_ times could we have are table cleaned .
0 needless to say i was very disappointed .
0 even the food was disappointing .
0 enough said , we would n't be returning .
0 i 'm not a big fan of this style of mexican food .
0 all i saw was the corn tortilla and sauce on my enchilada .
0 my enchilada was tasteless with just a tortilla and the meat and sauce .
0 and i did n't like this .
0 quality control needs to be taken care of .
0 wow , they could not have disappointed me more if they had tried !
0 the customer service sucked .
0 wo n't be back .
0 and it was bad .
0 really , really bad .
0 $ _num_ and i feel like i just ordered a salt lick .
0 that food was just nasty .
0 i had tacos here and the meat was really dry .
0 i have spoken to the manager before and no one seems to care .
0 a lot of my friends have already stopped coming for this reason .
0 yet , with each visit i am more disappointed .
0 flour tortillas are not supposed to taste like that .
0 oh filibertos you were such a disappointment tonight !
0 it took _num_ minutes for our order to come out .
0 the potatoes were obviously the frozen kind and the chorizo was subpar .
0 they did n't even get the horchata right , too sweet .
0 wo n't be visiting again .
0 i enjoy a lot of mexican food and this was definitely disappointing .
0 very incompetent employees working tonight .
0 i like that this filiberto 's is _num_ hours .
0 when we got home there was no salsa .
0 : ( we looked for the receipt , but could n't find it .
0 from now on i am always checking before we leave .
0 keep your receipt too in case you are missing half of what you ordered .
0 the chips are burning hot and melt the containers together .
0 in any case they just lost a long time customer .
0 i should have stopped sooner , oh well lesson learned .
0 not worth the hassle of trying to deal with these people .
0 unfortunately it has come to this .
0 potatoes in my az burrito were uncooked , almost as if raw .
0 has got to be the worse mcdonalds i have ever been too .
0 the seats were falling apart .
0 their sweet tea taste like sewer water and it 's not even sweet .
0 had to toss it .
0 their fries are not salty whatsoever and it 's so dry .
0 do n't go here , there 's wendy 's next door .
0 been a patron at rubio 's for a long time ; this one included .
0 this evening had my worst experience ever .
0 i ended up getting sick anyway , though .
0 i ordered the citrus salad tonight with shrimp .
0 they do n't even deserve _num_ star .
0 my windows look all bubbly and horrible .
0 i should have gotten my money back .
0 _num_ star because i did n't even get an appointment .
0 they were rude , short and completely unpleasant to deal with .
0 do not skip over it !
0 first of all , i do n't have a dog .
0 luckily for me , i save my receipts .
0 i really like chinese and thai food but this just does n't measure up .
0 bland and not even similar to thai red curry .
0 if you want thai food hit royal thai grill or thai rama .
0 stop by and give them a try you wo n't be disappointed .
0 , oyster sauce or both , thus making 'em not suitable for vegetarians .
0 found out it was not on the second .
0 tott 's fails to make the effort .
0 you wo n't be disappointed .
0 i do n't really get why this place has so many good reviews .
0 overall , not horrible food but i doubt i will eat here again .
0 even the cook gave me an attitude .
0 the guy on the phone said their tofu is only fried .
0 my girlfriend had the tofu curry which was ok she said , nothing special .
0 really , it was nothing to warrant even _num_ stars in my opinion .
0 `` like the river flow into the sea .
0 the food was n't that good but that was n't my main issue .
0 i will not be returning .
0 the owner was friendly with everyone in the restaurant except my boyfriend and i .
0 the total was $ _num_ which seemed reasonable .
0 it was just way too sweet and lacking flavor .
0 food was ok , not awesome .
0 not a good first impression .
0 you will see that there is n't a difference in the taste .
0 _num_ people on staff at the time , all were standing around talking .
0 one was still cold in the middle .
0 overall , if you like soggy breaded chicken then this place is for you .
0 sorry tots , i wanted to like you .
0 nasty and missing something .
0 fried rice was bland and old .
0 noticed _num_ employees eating lunch and they had pizza from another restaurant ?
0 there are way better choices around that area , no need to go back .
0 sad sad sad excuse for a cream cheese wonton .
0 it 's simple ; are there frozen peas and carrots used in the rice ?
0 the portion was huge , the veggies were fresh .
0 the owner , i am truly disappointed in .
0 apparently they consider chicken powder to be vegetarian .
0 if we had not already paid , i would have left .
0 thanks for the unpleasant experience .
0 the place was clean , not too crowded and the greeting was friendly .
0 everything tastes over processed .
0 very disappointed with the orange chicken and walnut shrimp .
0 will not be going back .
0 i 've been here _num_ times .
0 the orange chicken tastes nothing like orange chick it bland .
0 the pad tai was really bad , i could n't even eat half .
0 but sorry to say this place is nothing special .
0 got the red curry lunch with veggies , tofu , and brown rice .
0 not limp , crispy without being too raw .
0 trouble was the curry .
0 i 'm the wrong person to ask .
0 i also tried the chicken pot stickers .
0 i may be back the next time my son bugs me for pei wei .
0 tried the stir fry crispy beef and the spicy island chicken .
0 the chicken tastes horrible , dry and flavorless .
0 this is most certainly the worse chinese i have had in az .
0 i would honestly describe this food as a really bad pei wei knock off .
0 sorry - but we wo n't be going back to this place .
0 its already disrespect enough you are in this country .
0 so unless you want the establishment to be shut down .
0 decided to try something new tonight so we ordered takeout here .
0 take out should n't be that hard .
0 yeah i walked in to get it , but the result is the same .
0 if it was possible to give this place no stars i would .
0 it was very very dry and the meat was extremely chewy .
0 the taste was stale and the fried rice was rubbery and lacked flavor .
0 the flavors was bland and consistency wise it was just not appealing .
0 too bad , because i really wanted to like it too .
0 i saw someone else mention food poisoning with this place too .
0 the worst food ever .
0 please do n't waste your time going here .
0 was craving singapore noodles .
0 just boiled rice vermicelli .
0 no lemongrass or nothing thai about it .
0 dragon noodle , tasted like wax .
0 they did n't seem to bother about it .
0 just said they will let the chef know .
0 all we can taste was the sticky greasy noodles , pepper sauce .
0 we also ordered sesame chicken and orange chicken .
0 it was pure dark fatty batter coated sesame and orange chicken !
0 and never come back to this place ever again .
0 this second review is really unfortunate for me to have to post .
0 sad to say , i cancelled my order and will take my business elsewhere .
0 that was not my point .
0 they also inform me of delivery times and fees up front .
0 i am all for local , so do n't get me wrong .
0 `` shame on him .
0 what happened to my review ?
0 so , i paid just under a hundred dollars for dead flowers .
0 they should change and hire a real company .
0 the technician who came , did not come prepared .
0 keep in mind , this is still under warranty .
0 she told me that i need to have my freezer checked out .
0 refused to even send out a technician to check .
0 this has not happened before i got this system .
0 they 'll get your money , and then treat you like garbage .
0 cheap company that does n't want to do anything extra .
0 in the two years i 've had this system it has never worked properly .
0 the follow through in the office is terrible .
0 is too hard to get a hold of .
0 system is not the best !
0 i called the office and talked to samantha .
0 she sent an email and estimated _num_ hours labor .
0 no appointment was made so i had to call the office back again .
0 then _num_ hours labor at $ _num_ an hour .
0 i was not until the next week again .
0 do not use these folks for plumbing .
0 very disappointed on the time i wasted .
0 very poor customer service .
0 took me a month to get saturday appointment .
0 her tone of customer service is worst .
0 go spend your money to somewhere who will value you as customer .
0 clearly you do not have a++ rating ) ?
0 i always always get terrible customer service at this location .
0 if the tellers are not extremely awkward , they are being rude .
0 she gave me a dirty look and went to ask her manager .
0 i have opened my kids accounts elsewhere and have been thinking about switching .
0 i paid for my order and ate one wing at home .
0 wings were bland with little to no sauce .
0 just do n't bother going !
0 ordered _num_ hot wings .
0 forced to pay _num_ to use a debit card .
0 wings were done in _num_ mins .
0 i like the menu for dennys however this particular dennys is not that great .
0 the food tasted good , but everything else about dinner tonight was awful .
0 for someone working on tips you 'd think they would do a good job .
0 _num_ minutes to get some water .
0 everytime we go to this dennys we have nothing but problems .
0 the staff never check on you .
0 i really do n't like the way they run this place at all .
0 the first one was good but this one was horrible .
0 this is by far the worst denny 's i 've ever been to .
0 it 's not like they were busy .
0 to top it off the cashier we paid with was so rude .
0 she pretty much ruined my life .
0 service is awful at this location .
0 lackluster and mediocre service .
0 not recommended at all .
0 we sat for a total of _num_ minutes and we were never acknowledged .
0 everything else has always been a bit dry or bland .
0 do not eat here .
0 the food here is the worst chinese food we have ever tasted .
0 my girlfriend and i took one bite of our dinner and left .
0 garbage , junk and complete trash .
0 wish we could give this zero stars .
0 the place was empty so we had many seating options .
0 none of the tables were clean .
0 the napkin came up black , and this is not even an exaggeration .
0 but we could n't eat the soup .
0 general tso 's chicken was absolutely dreadful .
0 the won tons served with it were stale .
0 a lot can change in a year , and not for the good !
0 i used to think this place was decent , but no longer .
0 the sweet and sour chicken was anything but .
0 i am not sure what happened to this place .
0 it did n't taste like kung pao chicken .
0 i could n't finish it .
0 i see people walk in to eat but i never see them leave .
0 a co-worker said i should try here .
0 i 'm not sure he was talking about the same restaurant .
0 i walked in and there was just a guy asleep at the counter .
0 i have been treated nicely but then other times staff was pretty rude .
0 they have cheap prices but they seem to be pretty messy consistently .
0 i guess it depends on the day or the technician you get .
0 she refused to refund me and hung up on me .
0 very bad customer service .
0 they rush in and rush u out .
0 if you want fancy this is not the place .
0 very busy place and i question the cleanliness .
0 wish i could say the same about the staff .
0 do n't bother wasting your time !
0 service was way below my already low standards !
0 but hey , they 're finally taking all _num_ major credit cards !
0 what a horrible checkout procedure .
0 it 's like constantly buying things from best buy at christmas .
0 it 's been hard to find something with the same tip .
0 i tried one , which was wrong .
0 it then took another _num_ minutes to return my one item .
0 after that disaster was finally over , i headed to find another replacement .
0 they just looked at me and said `` no .
0 do you need help with anything else '' as they walked away .
0 not that they 'd care .
0 this has not been my experience at all .
0 and i miss it .
0 fry 's is a consistent disappointment .
0 their on-line inventory look up has been wrong every time i have used it .
0 i drive myself over there to find an empty shelf .
0 the check-out line is always long ( or worse ) .
0 help varies greatly from very useful to completely useless .
0 i hate to even give _num_ star to this location .
0 the sales associate sold us a product that did not include the package advertised .
0 i had plenty of money , it was n't about getting something for free .
0 it just looks nicer when you walk in than it used to .
0 props for nothing else though .
0 and they are either following you around , or avoiding you .
0 this is n't costco !
0 it 's the only reason i could n't do everything online .
0 i was very disappointed with fry 's last night .
0 it will probably be many more years before i visit them again .
0 they now price match all online pricing .
0 average prices , cheap products .
0 how else was i going to find out that it was defective , esp ?
0 probably more like a _num_ , or _num_ out of _num_ .
0 i 've never walked in there and come out with what i wanted .
0 every time i shop at frys , they are able to disappoint me further .
0 said no thanks and threw it in the trash .
0 last straw for this horrible place to shop .
0 shopping cart wo n't work - i keep getting an error .
0 she says `` oh i got an error . ''
0 she does it again from the beginning ... error again .
0 wait _num_ minutes and the box comes up .
0 agent tells me that not all items are on the same price .
0 goes to talk to someone and _num_ minutes later comes back and says no .
0 _num_ more minutes a supervisor comes over and asks .
0 guy gets nervous and says ok just a minute and leaves .
0 walked out completely empty handed and drove home .
0 not a pleasant experience , and will not be a return customer .
0 not that they are all like that , of course .
0 customer service was terrible , and insulting !
0 for me , it was a cheap chinese remote control helicopter .
0 the thing never even left the ground .
0 $ _num_ , down the drain .
0 hands down , the worst experience i have ever had .
0 thats when things turned ugly .
0 it was really awkward and very unprofessional !
0 way less hassle and better quality goods .
0 this was _num_ of the rare times i went to frys .
0 if they had _num_ stars , that 'd be my rating .
0 _num_ check out lanes and _num_ people working with a line _num_ customers deep .
0 you have i walk to the food section and enter .
0 even though they have like _num_ checkout registers , only _num_ will be open .
0 why do i torture myself by coming to this store ?
0 there were two different colors out on display with prices listed .
0 worst costumer service and after purchased service .
0 i just had the worst experience i have ever had at a retail store .
0 absolutely horrible experience all around .
0 they advertise items and then do n't honor the ad .
0 they claim it 's a mistake in printing .
0 management should be ashamed to not honor their ads .
0 i will not be shopping at this shady operation anymore .
0 the tv went white screen on me dec _num_ .
0 my daughter and i paid cash for a laptop computer .
0 we paid cash and should have walked out with cash .
0 this is totally ridiculous !
0 did n't need anything fancy , just a good product .
0 i try not to go here unless i can help it .
0 the customer service here is worse than you 'll find anywhere .
0 on one occasion , a female employee was typing away at a computer .
0 the associate i was connected to immediately told me they were all out .
0 sure enough , they had a whole shelf full .
0 i placed my order online , but they did not offer delivery .
0 when i got there , low and behold they did n't have my tv .
0 these people are dishonest & unprofessional .
0 my boyfriend and i went in the store this evening and received bad service .
0 this is the worst !
0 this place basically sucks .
0 there were more than _num_ people waiting and there were _num_ cashiers .
0 i 'm standing there for _num_ minutes and the line has barely moved .
0 lol , now i am glad i left that ridiculous waiting line .
0 what the hell is wrong with the employees here ?
0 ... i hate having to shop here !
0 coming to this place is always slightly disappointing .
0 they would get a negative rating from me if that were possible .
0 only thing i was n't very fond of is the customer service .
0 only employee that has beard .
0 his customer service is poor and he is n't very knowledgeable about car audio .
0 if you 're looking for car audio accessories you 're better off going elsewhere .
0 it 's been over a week and i still have n't got my computer .
0 i feel like they do n't care if they actually help me or not .
0 first rep i asked for help did n't look up from his computer screen .
0 unfortunately , their service has always been very sub par .
0 but once you do , they are fairly helpful and knowledgeable .
0 but just had a poor customer service experience .
0 it was on sale for $ _num_ which was $ _num_ cheaper than amazon .
0 unfortunately they were not very helpful .
0 the sales associates were rather rude .
0 it was very hard to get service .
0 they would not stop talking to each other long enough to help me .
0 sales people are very slow and do n't have much knowledge .
0 the attitude of customer service is shocking .
0 but again this could be the reason prices are lower than most places .
0 1st time there , went to buy a toy helicopter for my child .
0 not a good 1st time experience .
0 while some areas have large selections , this place is really falling apart .
0 half the displays are falling apart and do n't have the sound systems operating .
0 the aisle with sound bars is a joke .
0 not particularly helpful unless you know exactly what to ask .
0 i do n't quite know how they stay in business .
0 prices are n't usually any better than on line or most big box stores .
0 the service here is so bad .
0 fry 's electronics has so much potential .
0 it could be my go-to place for what i need .
0 i do n't understand why this is .
0 so i bought it for $ _num_ and tried it out at home .
0 but they do n't know this .
0 they will not refund me .
0 i am contacting the manufacturer right now but i do n't have much hope .
0 no apology no nothing .
0 even the cashier has horrible customer service skills .
0 so frustrating and disappointing .
0 will not be coming back .
0 try putting twice the sales people on the floor to help those in need .
0 would not recommend this place .
0 this place is beyond horrible .
0 i will never come back to this pathetic excuse for a store .
0 my cashier did not smile , barely said hello .
0 i love frys , but dread coming to this location .
0 will not be visiting fry 's electronics again .
0 o went for some speakers for my wife 's car and a phone charger .
0 especially when you 're approached by _num_ salespeople during your shopping time .
0 these guys are ripoff artists .
0 these guys are ripoff artists .
0 fry 's management , this situation speaks for itself .
0 no help to car even though they were supposed to help load it .
0 got it home , opened the box & tv was clearly used .
0 had to drive _num_ mins back to store .
0 staff was rude , unhelpful , and told us lies !
0 way to go frys ... i will never shop here again !
0 probably the most unpleasant experience i 've ever had .
0 once there he asked for the email print out that my order was ready .
0 he told me no he had to have the email .
0 why no pick up counter ?
0 what a complete waste of time and energy .
0 complete waste of time !
0 why anyone would ever shop there is beyond me .
0 the selection was poor !
0 the merchandise that was in stock was all basic .
0 it 's just not funny any more .
0 so i said `` thank you '' and walked away quickly .
0 this is not helping .
0 anyway , fry 's is official off my list .
0 anyway , just bought it on amazon web site .
0 amazon will always be your better bet .
0 i did n't miss it as i the information on the tag .
0 frys electronics has become such a disappointment when dealing with their extended warranty .
0 horrible place overall and little to no customer service .
0 but do n't expect any help from any of the employees .
0 they just did not want to help assist me .
0 no i ca n't show you ?
0 he had no respect .
0 he had this permanent disgusted look on his face .
0 no eye contact , no manners at all !
0 normally i do n't do subway because there are better choices out there .
0 said they did n't have any steak .
0 asked why at that time of day no steak .
0 stupid look and said he did n't know .
0 this was quite bad .
0 better pizza to be found within a _num_ min drive .
0 she then leaves to go to albertsons .
0 that 's _num_ minutes on a slow night .
0 they gave me fettuccine instead of chicken alfredo and hot wings instead of bbq .
0 my chicken looked like it was boiled .
0 i will never order from here again , not worth it .
0 also , they have chosen not to include salads with this order anymore !
0 our favorite has been the pan pizza .
0 in this case , it was bad .
0 no buffalo sauce in sight .
0 my daughter and son who ate the pizza are also sick today .
0 will not be going back that 's for sure .
0 management or staff needs to start paying attention .
0 its giving a bad name for chicago pizza .
0 dont waste your time or your $ .
0 here it is $ _num_ .
0 that being said , this place is very expensive for no reason .
0 $ _num_ for a _num_ '' pie is a bit ridiculous .
0 _num_ pm , `` how long for delivery if i order the ribs ? ''
0 i feel really bad for them .
0 this was my second visit .
0 this place is an insult to pizza , restaurants , and chicago .
0 gave their wings a try , buffalo style .
0 they only had two to choose from which kind of sucked .
0 they said they would be crispy but they were very soggy .
0 they were a descent size and not horribly priced .
0 the sauce was straight forward hot sauce , nothing special .
0 this store has no idea what hygiene is or how to run as management .
0 the manager asked me if i wanted another pizza delivered .
0 hire a better staff !
0 the cheese did not taste fresh as well .
0 the sausage and pepperoni as well as the sauce seemed ok .
0 sausage on dry bread .
0 i 've learned my lesson , no more rosati 's .
0 it smelled like fish .
0 nevertheless , not a fan !
0 the ranch fries were definitely a large portion as well , but nothing special .
0 they did not , plus the food itself was not very good !
0 customer service leaves a bit to be desired .
0 not very happy with the pharmacy .
0 dropped off my sick son 's medicine at 3pm .
0 i 'll try cvs next time .
0 waiting _num_ days for cough medicine .
0 by the time it comes in , i will not need it any longer !
0 there was n't a sign or anything on the computer .
0 shut your computers down if you are closed !
0 the guy who was training the new guy gave us a stink eye .
0 worse customer service ever !
0 i 'll just drive further to cvs , way nicer .
0 the service has went down hill for me this past year .
0 the service here completely sucks though .
0 they do n't even acknowledge you half the time .
0 i told the clerk this before she rang up $ _num_ worth of groceries .
0 `` express lane '' is a complete joke .
0 only shop here because it 's close to my home and easy access .
0 to bad there is n't negative stars .
0 she does n't know how to treat customers for sure .
0 she then proceeded to ask someone else to finish checking us in .
0 i would definitely not recommend this place ever .
0 i just went in and asked for 1/2 inch off my already short hair .
0 they sent someone out a week later to give me a bid .
0 if it was possible to give zero stars i would .
0 we had nothing but problems .
0 they damaged our ceiling and said they would repair it .
0 the damage they caused is over $ _num_ .
0 acted like the did n't believe me .
0 all i ordered was _num_ large fries , it took _num_ minutes .
0 tried ordering sundaes also and they had no spoons !
0 if i could give a _num_ for this mcdonald 's i would .
0 this seriously is the worst , i mean very worst fast food place ever .
0 they hire really lame employees and do not properly stock their supplies .
0 they said , oh , sorry .
0 if you do n't sell , ice , then why advertise for it ?
0 -the ketchup dispenser was out of ketchup .
0 do n't ever visit this location .
0 how hard is it to get an order correct ... i mean damn .
0 this is the worst mcdonalds ever .
0 clearly they are trying to get their drive thru wait times to look fast .
0 it 's 7pm , it 's not rush hour .
0 first was bad but decided to try again second mistake .
0 went back and explained the error acted like no problem .
0 very poor mcdonald 's overall .
0 that is not true !
0 if you are starving , sure , stop here and get something .
0 to make it worse , they kept serving them to other drive-thru customers !
0 this mcdonald 's is a joke .
0 the staff are not trained and are basically clueless .
0 very obvious that this place lacks good management !
0 i wish that yelp would offer less than _num_ star .
0 my experience today was by far the worst of any fast food chain ever .
0 i thought it was _num_ again .
0 will not let a customer complain and vent .
0 unfortunately you can not give negative stars .
0 from the time i ordered till delivery was _num_ hour and _num_ minutes .
0 will not let a customer complain and vent .
0 after waiting way over an hour i called and the manager was rude .
0 there should be a zero star option .
0 after waiting way over an hour i called and the manager was rude .
0 pizza is good for cheap pizza .
0 when ordering they do n't advise of specials .
0 this is not gourmet pizza and charging gourmet prices is unacceptable .
0 the employees are not helpful or friendly .
0 wow , never will i order from dominos again .
0 this location is terrible !
0 if that were the only issue , i would n't be writing this review .
0 he said they 'd remake my food , but it would take even longer .
0 courtesy gets an f rating from me .
0 do n't go here for your banking .
0 their customer service is terrible and they are incompetent .
0 another thing to beware of is fees .
0 basically , they are charging you $ _num_ per month for a paper statement .
0 i tried using the service without success and was forced to cancel the transaction .
0 it just seems greedy to me .
0 all i did was deposit checks and send an electronic mortgage payment each month .
0 plus i was also getting charged $ _num_ a month for each account .
0 if you open an account , make sure you know all the fees .
0 every visit i dread it !
0 after _num_ days your screwed .
0 do n't let this happen to you .
0 walked in to get info about opening a checking account .
0 the woman did n't even look up to make eye contact .
0 what looked great on the pan turned out to be a runny mess .
0 it was the worst pizza i have eaten in years .
0 the service was also awful .
0 i have given this place a try twice .
0 not a great place to eat in my opinion just greasy bar food .
0 they use peanut oil and do n't inform customers .
0 it is not on their menus or on their website .
0 and that is the problem .
0 the portion of chicken this time was not enough for a toddler .
0 we first went to chase which took all of ten minutes .
0 they were quite busy , apparently .
0 to that i received a reply she did not have one .
0 considering there customer service has not been the most exceptional .
0 well i would n't charge us to hold on to our money .
0 id protect me 24/7 is one of them and it is a horrible company .
0 anyways , they could n't help me .
0 it was a waste of a trip , and a waste of my time .
0 had to drop another star because of how ridiculous this bank is .
0 but , i should n't be paying for that anyways .
0 um ... no thanks !
0 they are the worst credit union in arizona .
0 they are still the worst probably in the whole us .
0 will never return or recommend , terrible service .
0 do your research before you step into this unprofessional and unethical place .
0 everything they get away with is wrong .
0 very unappealing first impression of a business !
0 the waiting line was very long before noon on wednesday as well .
0 run to a different place unless you have good lube .
0 you will get screwed .
0 his employee even apologies to me and said he does it to everyone .
0 wish i had done more research first .
0 and the guys in the shop are just as bad .
0 water in the fuel mean all new fuel lines .
0 _num_ hours later the ice maker was still not dropping ice .
0 he was correct , it was not working .
0 keep in mind , i 'm not trying to get something for free here .
0 so i guess i 'll just do that .
0 but that did n't really work out .
0 i was assigned to appliance repair from my home warranty company .
0 appliance express is not open on mondays .
0 service tech was creepy !
0 * & $ % wtf ?
0 his dismal attempt at humor did not stop there .
0 i requested another service tech on the 2nd call .
0 phoenix heat is brutal on plastic !
0 not sure i would want used parts .
0 if i could give a lower review than one star i would .
0 this company is rude , unorganized , and unprofessional .
0 2pm rolls around , they did n't show again !
0 i check out the ice maker , still broken no ice being made .
0 no such luck so i call them again .
0 they tell me they fixed it and billed the manufacturer .
0 i advised them its not fixed .
0 i call appliance express and at this point i am extremely upset .
0 i get a call from scott and set up _num_ hour window .
0 technician said he would order parts and then would return to repair .
0 they stated parts did not arrive yet and would check the next day .
0 each week i called i would get the same 5-7 day message .
0 friendly employee greeted me as i walked in .
0 the staff here is so rude and quick to judge you .
0 not to mention the staff looked like they were straight from the ghetto .
0 can not rate any lower .
0 they refuse to remove me from their call list .
0 they then hung up on me .
0 i would rate value village at the worst possible company .
0 i will never , never , ever !
0 they will not stop .
0 prices are too high , i repeat , too high .
0 staff was not pleasant to say the least .
0 will not be back .
0 they have horrible customer service all of the employees have very bad customer service .
0 the store is very dirty .
0 would n't recommend this thrift store .
0 try another one that has better customer service and prices .
0 this is the first time in _num_ years i bought an american made car .

0 my experience here was dreadful .
0 it looked like a dump .
0 i hate these big pharmacy chains !

0 many items lacked price tags .
0 it was too much !
0 this is where old clothes go to die .

0 it was n't like there was any seating .
0 we tried to support downtown and felt bad that we were denied .
0 they are open late and down there and have never let me down .
0 horrible service and the hand wash is worthless .
0 _num_ regular car washes pass before they even got to my car .
0 worst car wash experience ever .
0 bell road has the worst customer service ever .
0 why the heck would i want to get out of my car too early .
0 no one even acknowledged me so i asked .

0 also i feel pretty sad for those that work there .
0 i heard someone yelling at employees and yelling about employees .

0 i 'm very dissapointed and will never return to this location !
0 worst car wash that i have ever had .
0 i will not be returning .
0 why would i pay for wheels to get cleaned and they 're not ?
0 horrible - i paid to have my interior vacuumed and wiped down .
0 they charge a pretty hefty fee for sub par work .

0 one of these days i 'll remember that they are terrible and stop going .
0 all if it was in plain view .
0 that 2nd guy is the only reason this is a _num_ star review .

0 he told me oh less than an hour you 're the first one in .
0 i went inside and sat down to wait .
0 well i was wrong .
0 then was told he 's with a customer and would call me back .
0 this past week was my last time taking my car here .
0 sad that i have to find another place after so many years .
0 took an hour to get my car washed .
0 they tried to break into my car when they locked the keys in .

0 the meat itself had no flavor .
0 the thousand island dressing on the burgers was very thin and runny .
0 it had no flavor whatsoever .

0 that 's a no .
0 not good at all !
0 i 'm not exaggerating .
0 the toilet looked as if never cleaned .
0 fries are tasteless , greasy and i suspect cooked in old oil .
0 first of all , the burgers themselves are pretty lame .
0 not to mention the man taking my order had a coke nail .
0 i could n't eat them .
0 the burger was ok , but poor quality beef .
0 also could not finish that .
0 in chicago , the crust is crunchy and flaky .

0 then to top off the crappy food was the staff .

0 apparently i much prefer ny style pizza , not chicago .
0 i miss the pizza from my old hood ( aiello 's ) .
0 apparently , it is closed !
0 there is no way to get any food .
0 so , i would skip this one .
0 this is n't even where i started out to go for lunch today .
0 i was driving down the road and it caught my eye .

0 save your money and go somewhere else or they will rip you off !
0 no parmesan cheese and not even an apology !
0 we got the worst delivery driver ever .
0 i 've been craving this place since then .
0 store is a mess .
0 the fountain drink had been down for _num_ days .
0 it seems that corporate does not care .
0 unfortunately , my husband and i had a terrible experience at this uniform place .

0 we did not have such a great experience .
0 kinda funny , kinda not .
0 hubs ordered some type of sandwich which he was immediately pissed off about .
0 the salad was very small and very old looking , wilted lettuce .
0 these guys were horrible !
0 no sense of urgency .
0 am yet to get a call back .
0 on top of never getting status updates about what was going on .
0 i guess they did have a lot of good ash trays .
0 as brake shops go there are no worse than most .
0 so why only two stars ?
0 i made my appointment and was told _num_ min on the phone .
0 i was originally told i only needed the $ _num_ alignment .
0 when i questioned them on the price they quickly changed it to $ _num_ .
0 the place is busy .
0 will not be back .
0 too many other places in phoenix .
0 this is the worst apartment complex i have ever experienced .
0 she avoided me like the plague .
0 the place was disgusting and completely filthy .
0 no wonder i had roaches !
0 do n't even consider this place !
0 the end result is functional doggie door on a messy wall .

0 i tried to reason with her but she kept arguing and was very nasty .
0 she even insulted my two remaining guests by telling them how messy they were .
0 ok - we were disappointed but we scheduled it for early january .
0 another disappointment but we rescheduled for later in the month .
0 you need to call at least _num_ hours in advance to make the reservation .
0 the coupon price does not include tax and gratuity .
0 they then direct you to another restroom away from diners .
0 i wish i had taken a picture of the sign .
0 like i said , not worth the regular price of $ _num_ .
0 there was no nut free alternative .
0 my client had no clue of my allergy and could not have known .
0 i do n't really understand how this happened .

0 it was supposed to be special - but it was a disaster .

0 this is the worst machine shop to go to .
0 where does the staff go , and wash their hands ?

0 i ca n't believe how we were treated and served .
0 i felt uncomfortable in the dining area and there was a strange smell .
0 the ladies were allowed to be left alone to do their cleaning .
0 jay and his ladies told me they knew nothing about it .
0 this was my first time using mm and i will never use them again .
0 such a rip off !
0 to make matters worse , their customer service is awful .
0 i was lied to and ripped off and really caution against using this company .
0 this was just the closest place to my house .
0 the price was reasonable so we placed an order for all windows measured .
0 so strange that a business owner would blow off a large job like this .
0 the chicken was not only cold in the middle and burn on the outside .
0 i 'm not just saying that it was dry chicken .
0 the fact that it was empty should have told me something .
0 the salad was not exactly fresh , the dressing tasted funny .
0 god knows how long it was in that warmer ... .
0 there was a line out of the door for pizza when i arrived .
0 so , i stood in line for a very long time .
0 so , i asked , `` which flavors are available tonight ? ''
0 she said : `` we just have pepperoni tonight . ''
0 had a really poor experience here .
0 the place is very old and that makes it look very dirty .
0 the bathroom was so disgusting that i walked back out .
0 the pizza was missing some toppings too .
0 we have n't gone back and probably never will .
0 they even had butt stains on the cushions .
0 _num_ weeks later ... .
0 chairs came ... and they 're the wrong color .
0 okay , now i 'm definitely not paying the difference for the chairs .
0 fortunately , they did n't argue price .
0 i have never been so horrified in my entire life .
0 you are greeted by a giant stuffed bear in a glass case .
0 no calls to apologize for change of delivery date .
0 we have not had a great experience with lee 's quality counter tops .
0 the service was not friendly but fairly quick .
0 i would rather take my wife and kids to taco bell after tonight .
0 it 's also not as clean as it used to be .
0 first this place is not cheep .
0 food was n't good and way !
0 a few weekends ago , i went in to sell some old jewelry .

0 food was mediocre at best , service was subpar .
0 me of why i disliked chicken in the past .
0 it surely did n't taste like chicken .
0 the rice was tasteless till i poured the salsa over it .
0 the refried beans is typical refried beans out of a can .
0 i mean , they were my guests .
0 plus , they are from a city that does n't do mexican food well .
0 not so happy cashier lady .
0 but i am expecting flavor with a little kick .
0 not friendly but not rude either .
0 the cheese inside was not soft and melted as it once was .
0 my daughter ordered the cheese enchilada last week and was of the same opinion .
0 the customer service has gone down as well as the food quality .
0 please pedro 's get it together you were my all time favorite place .
0 there is only one old guy who actually knows what he 's talking about .

0 i do n't like that they charge you to sit in that room .
0 the beer was cheaper .
0 also , if you have a large group , i would recommend somewhere else .
0 the bartenders seemed bored , no real energy in the place .
0 can i give a no star rating ?
0 but , no more .
0 so it 's too bad they wo n't be on that list .
0 as it turns out it was a total disappointment .
0 the bar tender is rude and not very accommodating to customer needs .
0 he came back slammed the drink on the table and walked away .
0 it was still horrible .
0 when we took a bite it was way to dry and tasted rather stale .
0 i guess it was n't the best or the worst iv had .
0 honestly i would n't waist my time or money on this place .
0 i 've always had their club sandwich which never disappointed me .
0 the fish was n't that great either and the cole slaw was even worse !
0 there is not a lot of parking for a bar this big inside .
0 there are tv 's everywhere but they are n't very big tv 's .
0 the fries were the only good thing about both sandwiches .
0 my philly was literally the worst i have ever had .
0 he is used to club sandwiches stacked with meat .
0 my husband 's bud light in a bottle was $ _num_ .
0 it is so dated !
0 he has the new id so i do n't know what the problem was .
0 we really did not care for the atmosphere .
0 wo n't be going back .
0 grade school cafeteria was not what i expected .
0 the management not so good .
0 the exterior is tired and the inside needs updated .
0 he fired christine , who has been there _num_ years .
0 five negative stars are n't even enough .
0 my advice : do n't go there unless you like creepy men .
0 not even creepy old men .
0 i do not and will never set foot in there .
0 egg roll i think not grease stick !
0 sadly our food was n't very good .
0 personally she should have just let the answering machine pick up .
0 so king wah closed for like a month back in october .
0 we are sad , this was our go to chinese delivery .
0 some dishes perfect , others too salty , too bland , etc .
0 you do n't need to have every possible dish on the menu .
0 _num_ cents more and not even a sorry .
0 sigh , we 're regulars too .
0 we ordered dinner combos with orange chicken and kung pao chicken .
0 we were extremely disappointed .
0 not only was the food made of low quality it had horrible flavor .
0 this is by far one of the worst chinese food places we have tried .
0 they seemed very put out we were trying to place a to go order .
0 the place was empty so there should not be rushed .
0 she just said he said no .
0 not impressed at all .
0 egg drop soup was plain , no veggies , tofu etc .
0 ordered the mongolian chicken - way too salty and oily .
0 cashew chicken , same thing .
0 worst chinese food i ever had .
0 i was so disappointed .
0 it would n't surprise me that the business is going to be closed soon .
0 being a chinese does n't mean you know how to cook chinese food .
0 you need to be a chef to run a restaurant .
0 my usual chinese spot was closed so we ventured here .
0 i thought it was just one dish but no , it was everything .
0 work was performed at the surprise location .
0 the bill was about $ _num_ .
0 and , wow , what a miss .
0 secondly , they have no tartar sauce or malt vinegar .
0 how on earth do you even run a fish place with no tartar sauce ?
0 skip the fish , it 's awful .
0 because pete has not stepped into the 21st century yet !
0 which by the way did not have its price listed .
0 wrong again $ _num_ !
0 ugh i had to spit it out .
0 i did n't care for the red sauce on my fish .
0 the worst fish and chips i have ever had .
0 i ca n't believe people think this is good .
0 overpriced processed food and unfriendly service .
0 sucks that i had to give such a low rating !
0 now originally i was born in glendale , but was raised in long beach !
0 glad i set my expectations low .
0 pete 's fish is ok , square , almost like processed but not .
0 the onion rings were good ( super greasy though ) .
0 they may be trying to do too many things at once here .
0 i would not go out of my way to eat at pete 's again .
0 what the hell is that .
0 the fries were questionable .
0 this place serves nothing but frozen seafood .
0 nothing had any flavor at all .
0 not worth the trip .
0 why are people lining up for disgusting frozen fish ?
0 shrimp was _num_ % batter .
0 instead of fish , fish patties .
0 this is n't what i had in london .
0 the shrimp were n't good either ; tasted extremely fishy .
0 the fries were soggy and bland .
0 the sandwich was very crunchy and the nuggets were nothing special .
0 they were very thin and mostly crust .
0 when tasting without the sauce they were bland .
0 no one cleaning tables during the time i was there .
0 we use to go to pete 's all the time back in the day .
0 just nasty is all i can really say .
0 i had the _num_ piece fish and _num_ piece shrimp .
0 the best way to sum this up is frozen overly processed fish .
0 frozen processed fish patties are not fish and chips .
0 first sign of i should have left was no credit card machine .
0 all in all very shady charges for a meal not very good .
0 the banquet would probably be better .
0 my first clue was when i was told there was no malt vinegar .
0 i was disappointed with everything i ordered .
0 if you are from the coast , do n't waste your money !
0 for a quarter you could get two fish sandwiches .
0 i remember the patties being thicker with more fish and less breading .
0 this being said this store has taking an all time low .
0 what 's with the little flat over cooked dry shrimp nuggets , terrible .
0 maybe a little salt to bring out the flavors will help .
0 the fish patty was not very good .
0 although the shrimp was pretty good , nothing else i had was .

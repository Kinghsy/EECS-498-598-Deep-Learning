the casino has an old appearance , decor .
dishonest and high pressure .
my super picky family left raving about how delicious and fresh everything was .
it 's just a pool and a small hot tub .
wo n't come back to harrahs again .
i liked this hotel !
the food and drinks were good too .
unfortunately my girlfriend and i made the mistake of actually getting a room here .
all in all , i would not go back .
the chinese chicken salad is a great compliment and totally delicious .
the front desk lady kept trying to put me into a smaller room .
our server was also very friendly and did a great job .
the stuffed dates are excellent and the mac & cheese is heaven .
even if i had a free night i would not stay there again .
they sent me to new york new york .
i think i have a new favorite shoe store !
our server was neil and he was very informative and attentive to our needs .
i love tapas , and these guys do it well .
i got a small beef taco and a chicken taco .
having a view of the fountains during dinner was an added bonus .
everything i 've tried here so far was really good .
the kitchen could n't even spare a second to check if it was done ?
my husband and i were asked _num_ times in one day before _num_ am .
very attentive and compassionate .
was not greeted by cashier .
a testament to it 's goodness !
why not just update all the rooms ?
much better filipino food elsewhere and not overpriced as this place .
the kids had such a good time !
no bacon at the buffet breakfast !
stay far away from this place !
everything we had was absolutely yummy .
my husband was ill and stayed behind .
great atmosphere , but the food was unremarkable and overpriced .
the reason why i gave it another star was because of the customer service .
but alize should really just give up already .
by far one of the best experiences i have had in vegas !
customer service is pretty much non existent , they 're rude and slow .
the bread was freaking awesome !
by far one of my favorite places to dine in vegas !
the steak was perfect , flavorful , tender , and delicious .
best wig shop hands down in vegas .
small plates so bring other people and order a lot to share .
also the annoying security asking for room keys everytime by the elevators !
he was prompt on delivery and pick up , and set up everything nicely .
this is the worst vegas experience i have ever had .
i will not be staying at this hotel in the future .
also ... the ac units are crazy loud .
it is always a fun time at circus circus .
by $ _num_ really ?
my favorite place to come when in las vegas .
the bacon wrapped dates are amazing , the flavor combination is great .
, and the decor is generic and worn .
good sangria and excellent tapas !
there goes _num_ more star !
as for the rooms ... old old old .
so i wait some more .
my advice ... do n't even try it .
the owner told me `` _num_ minutes . ''
if you 're in vegas i recommend this place big time !
our dinner was perfect .
the rooms and bathrooms are badly outdated and dirty looking .
this is the best fitness club i 've been to .
she was very professional , calm and reassuring while i was being worked on .
it was so loud and lasted it for over _num_ minutes .
also , the sangria is quite tasty .
perhaps it really is quite good , or maybe i began with low expectations .
cons : front desk staff hate their job .
i 've stayed at many caesars properties but this one has been the worst .
they 're open late and the sangria is also quite delicious !
so , we ordered more ... big mistake .
or heck , just go for really good soup and bread !
thanks to the entire hugo boss staff at the forum shops location !
this place will make for a great night in vegas .
it was the highlight of our meal ( as was the creamed corn ) .
the food is made to order and tastes great .
i would recommend this place to anyone that enjoys tapas .
only some of the veggies were actually cooked .
it 's not worth it .
she is very detail orientated ... must ask for jenny !
we were visiting las vegas and our daughter had a very high fever .
my request was ignored .
would n't go there for dinner the wow factor just is n't there .
she is professional and very nice !
i will never return just because of the show ticket sales people alone .
excellent service and the food was spot on .
that was a _num_ star experience .
there was no mention of resort fees being added .
jello shots are fun , too .
their calamari was spot on delicious , but that mushroom puff pastry was spectacular .
the bread is also delicious !
no , i 'll never have pizza here again .
the place is clean , easy to locate and staff is friendly and prompt .
second of all the air conditioning was way too loud .
my wife took my watch eight months ago to get it fixed .
please do n't waste your time here .
normally we have to wait about 15-20 minutes .
i just ignored them even when they are just saying good morning .
it was very blah .
so there is no `` sure fire '' time to get valet .
it has so many stops to the strip .
i loved the tomato soup and grilled brie sandwich .
this store is beautiful , the staff was very polite and helpful .
the place is kind of outdated and needs new clean carpet !
i do n't even know where to start this place is soo horrible .
pretty much an overpriced .
you got the wrong one !
it 's still a winner .
when i checked into my room , the bathtub had a clogged drain .
i doubt i will get food from here again .
the wait staff is professional and courteous .
, things got annoying upon our arrival at the harrah 's .
now , again , i understand this , as frustrating as it was .
well , i was satisfied .
everything was stale and gross .
the sa 's here are so cute !
the service is always good there , and i love the decor !
however , i think this place is over rated .
sensational food , great service and fun people watching .
sensational food , great service and fun people watching .
with that being said ... the whole casino smelled like smoke .
ran me away with ease .
there is product messed up everywhere .
instead i got a service that even the worst motel would never give .
gorgeous flowers for our wedding .
fantastic service and amazing tech guys .
portion sizes were great & the atmosphere was amazing .
but the pool was nice and buffet is reasonable .
well worth the money , it was truly an experience of a lifetime !
we will definitely be back for more .
affordable package and everyone 's friendly !
the final straw for me is the difficulty in booking a room .
i can not recommend this place enough , just make sure you make reservations !
keep up the good work .
the ginger was perfect and the oysters tasted fresh like the sea .
bar staff was great .
went there super hung over from an epic night and the food is perfect .
- no wifi ... .
the service is impeccable , the food is wonderful , and the decor elegant .
i love their salads , entree 's and desserts .
the worst hotel i 've ever had in vegas or maybe anywhere .
we did n't even sit down .
it just did n't leave a good taste in our mouths .
everything we ordered was good .
it 's nothing luxurious , but it gets the job done !
also during our process , the customer service was terrible .
a condescending store manager .
this gucci is a nice one with good selection .
so , yay for fun bartenders .
: ) the story does n't end there .
i was treated very poorly by their supervisor joy .
do n't think we will be staying here again .
great , beautiful , and perfect priced !
have n't stayed here in a while and am reminded why .
great job dragon noodle !
the miracle mile one is big and the line moves fast .
we spent our time on our vacation trying to avoid the hotel room .
still in my top _num_ favorite restaurants .
what goes around comes around , and they will get theirs !
a classic in las vegas , has been here for years .
it may seem a lil pricey , but its definitely worth the money .
the rooms are good and the staff is friendly .
i recommend splitting that between two people .
but you 're awesome whoever you are .
the service was excellent and our water glasses were never close to empty .
( not sure if it 's per night ) .
i wish i could take my surgeon to another office but i ca n't .
good go to the basics too since they are open late .
even the bread and butter they bring out it good .
if i could give this place no stars i would .
atmosphere is nice and tropical ( as one would expect ) .
the smell was so bad i had to get a different room .
although not on the menu , i managed to order a spicy margarita .
great food , great service , solid ambiance .
the margaritas , chips , and entrees are excellent !
excellent service for s reasonable price .
that 's just bad planning right there .
the anniversary menu was a real blast from the past .
our waiter was very attentive and had great food recommendations .
the taste however again was on the flavorless side .
the pool with the slides the arcade with all those toys to win !
i have n't eaten there.
it came out cold and tasted as if it had been sitting around .
i did really enjoy my stay here !
this place is located inside the venetian .
according to my friend , steak tacos were meh .
everything i tasted was good .
food is too expensive .
i call and leave messages but they never call back .
nice spot with `` local '' flavor in las vegas .
prices are reasonable , service is great , and the ambiance is trendy .
: ) so upgrade it is , to a suite .
friendly staff and fresh warm food .
the food took a bit long to prepare , but definitely worth the wait .
my in laws room was the worst !
do they really think people are that stupid ?
it was one of those rare dishes you hope never ends .
it has all these different areas with different vibes .
i think i love you .
we received free tickets to this event and almost passed it up .
find similar deals at much better properties .
the staff was friendly yet extremely rushed .
next time i will waste my money at the mgm right across the street .
the buffet left much to be desired at excalibur and luxor .
super friendly staff and a great way to try a bunch of different dishes .
we all know how vegas lines are !
service was alright , was n't rude and not a problem .
our room was clean but we had a very ugly and limited view .
and the service was great too .
i hate that he gets paid ( lots of money ! )
service , atmosphere - awesome .
i am never ever gon na use lady 's foot locker .
otherwise , people everywhere ... gross !
it is all well priced , quickly made and extremely satisfying .
so smooth , so flavorful , so worth the visit !
its a lot of fun .
firefly was a good choice .
we had about _num_ different tapas to share and they were all wonderful .
i 've been here a couple of times and enjoyed both of them .
high end clothes with high end prices .
the service is okay but their always super busy .
perfect portion sizes and loads of flavour .
when it finally arrived it was tender but with very little taste .
the clientele is very ghetto .
great selection of tapas .
ok , that is it i have said too much .
we 'll definitely be back .
will not come again and will not recommend .
only coming here for the bakery in the future .
superb attention to service .
another strike , excalibur .
even though my expectations were low i have to say that i am disappointed .
room was huge and we had great service .
we will be back next time we are in town !
loved the dark red ambiance and lounge furniture .
but our waiter was mia .
the chips were warm and fresh and the salsa was awesome .
the menu for lunch was nice and the service was excellent .
really enjoyed the atmosphere , food , & prices .
michael before dinner then some last minute shopping .
support staff was friendly .
our instructor was lance , he was great .
the philly with mushrooms and cheese ... .
she told me the excalibur never checks anyone in before 3pm without the fee .
i was too shocked to say forget it .
the staff are always nice .
the only good thing about this hotel is the location .
the flautas were amazing .
it 's like home away from home .
great wait to see the vegas strip from another point of view .
but i 'd rather not .
salami and egg breakfast was excellent .
food and drinks are amazing !
everything was early , coordinated and perfect .
you ca n't really mess up a salad so those were fine ... .
the thai beef salad and beef and mushroom skewers are always a must .
this is so much fun !
it saved so much time .
food at the westside deli was also tasty and affordable .
my partner had the standard caesar and enjoyed it as well .
when i complained , they did n't even apologize .
but when i went to shower the drain was clogged !
if you are looking for great tapas , this just is n't the place .
just had a wonderful stay at harrah 's !
i 've done this a few times as well & it 's still amazing !
i really like this place and the atmosphere .
the steaks are great with lots of flavor .
i noticed that all the frozen drink places do this !
the hotel towers seem nice .
oh , and the service has always been good here .
this place is in the venetian and was incredible .
the worse stay in vegas ever .
i 'd hate to get stuck here ... worst nightmare come true .
needless to say i will never go back here .
security was rude and ignorant .
he did n't offer us a free room .
worst customer service ever .
worst customer service ever .
worst customer service ever .
off to the pool .
men 's clothing is on the second floor and was plenty stocked .
the coconut shrimp and seafood chowder soup is my favorite .
very extensive menu with something for everyone .
a little sweet but excellent .
love the customer service here .
came here for happy hour .
we love this place .
we love this place .
i will never reccommend this place either .
he was very patient with me in finding the right wig .
anything to try and take a buck from ya .
superior service by james .
i will definitely have to come back next time .
i got hooked up with a suite with a nice view overlooking the strip .
i will gladly pay for quality food that was obviously made with love .
insurance companies really need to investigate this place for insurance fraud .
this is the 2nd time i 've been here .
they have shuttle service to varies resorts to pick you up .
its always packed here so you really should call ahead and make reservations .
sad because _num_ months ago we had the same experience .
the location is just perfect .
ed and jessica are the worst .
he could not have been any more rude .
well i was wrong to pick this place .
the sauce that was served with it was amazing .
flautas are a must have ... .
the shower head was old and needed to be replaced .
i just loved this place .
seems they do n't have a set price .
we really enjoyed our meal at circo .
our waiter was very knowledgeable and helped me make a great decision .
ridiculously overpriced , you 're better off going anywhere else .
staff was extremely unhelpful .
i had low expectations going in , and they did not meet them .
light , fresh , and good .
i prefer the mango or pina colada one !
it adds an authentic touch to the sweet tasting drink .
little jenny can works magic .
they do n't know how to enter payments , change info etc .
the service started out like crap and picked up toward the end .
the place looks like its abandoned .
something going on with yelp review situation and this restaurant .
delicious and i 'm a real asian .
seriously they are one of the best .
it takes away from what it is .
he was very nice , quick and made my drink amazing .
the other lady was trying to rush through the busy line .
our other favorite dish is their first of the day catch fish .
consistently delicious with incredible service .
is there a way to avoid it ?
would n't even give _num_ star .
i found the monorail to be of great use .
he seems to not care by any means !
what a brilliant location for a walgreens .
and you definitely have to order a pitcher of the sangria .
i filed a complaint and nothing has been taken care of .
i was like so pissed , and i just left .
the worst first impression ever !
he came home with nasty looking steaks .
the appetizers were all really good and the selection of drinks is pretty extensive .
got me to a state that i wanted .
we picked this one for our kids .
when i arrived they requested these documents .
i got the _num_ octane with an extra shot .
service was great , food was delicious , and the atmosphere was inviting .
not only was each bite of food utterly delicious but the presentation was amazing .
visited during spring break _num_ with my husband .

dinner at the oyster bar was fantastic !
he was patient with us , explained everything great .

thank you discount firearms for a great experience !
_num_ x better plus the people who work their are rude .
perfectly cooked , perfectly seasoned , perfectly served from beginning to end .
the bartender was super friendly as well .
i said umm this is n't what i ordered .
i hated paying the daily $ _num_ resort fee plus tax .
my boyfriend and i stayed here a few months ago to celebrate my 21st .
the infused vodka martini was the winner of the night .
looking for italian in las vegas , look elsewhere .
it took us _num_ minutes to get us drinks .
and the crispy wonton was over exposed and just way to much .
our server was very nice and attentive .
but i guess you get what you pay for .
i am a big fan of this place !
their instructor was very attentive and professional .
always friendly faces here !
i signed up for yelp just so i could leave this review .
but the bagels are the best ones i had outside of new york city .
( bc i felt it was taking too long !
we walked here and there just everywhere with our luggage with horrible customer service .
very quiet room with view of the strip .
over _num_ hours for check in .
in sales - sean has always been helpful and well informed .
he said ok sorry about that and that was it .
totally worth going that mile off the strip .
the inside is n't much better .
this store has very unique jewelry based on coins and other ancient artifacts .
perfect area on the strip and near the clubs .
the guacamole and queso fundido were excellent .
short staff , long lines , and multiple outlets .
the food is great and the service is fantastic .
did i mention that i was a virgin until i was _num_ ?
_num_ minutes after that we ordered water to drink .
we will not consider staying here again .
awesome food , great people to meet and great sangria !

such reasonable pricing for great food .
nice layout right on the canal at the venetian .
i went with a party of _num_ , so tip was automatically included .
alas , there are so many more names i ca n't recall .
the games are cool .
the ladies then went out around _num_ .
i had never had it and it was absolutely delicious .
last night something went horribly wrong .
there is n't much to offer here anyhow .
wonderful salads and soups .
love coming here before class .
it 's a great place to overly entertain your guests on the strip .
each time we come to vegas , this is a must .
mini suite room - more expensive no couch room was run down .
i could n't even imagine what one looks like .
overall though a great dinning experience and we would eat here again .
awesome service and beautiful decor .
the bathroom was a disaster .
rough impression from visiting the other _num_ casinos ?
also the mojito pitchers are delicious .
very disappointed for a dennys .
the only thing that was edible was the pot stickers .
i thought this was a great way to get back to my car .
even _num_ a night would have been fair to us but not $ _num_ .
my room , i did not love it .
atmosphere was not live .
rude does n't begin to cover it .
it 's a must-try !
my edamame was mushy and the seaweed salad was meh .
this walgreens is beautiful .
as a single female i was not comfortable walking around alone .
great pizza , awesome service martini 's rock .
always my first stop in vegas to get properly started !
a great place for breakfast .
now it was $ _num_ plus the balance on the credit card .
i 'm the manager here and i need this table . ''
no no no no no no no and no !
the location is not ideal to me .
even though we wound up getting married elsewhere , we had a blast here .
she called sushi _num_ and asked for the hours for all you can eat .
great food right by the canal inside the venetian las vegas .
well worth the trip off the strip .
best little tapas joint in vegas !
years ago , my toddler fell and split her bottom lip in the bath .
they are not cheap and they make rich drinks .
and then tell your waitress it 's nevada state law .
overall it was a great lunch time deal .
great place to get your happy you on with friends or family .
ordered a prime rib _num_ weeks early for christmas dinner .
did not think one would actually be my car unfortunately .
saying i love this place is an understatement .
same bottle was still there at 10pm .
this place has excellent food and the service was great as well .
from the moment we walked in , we knew it was a mistake !
the reviews on the service at the pool were horrible .
jenny is the best .
i loved my lychee sunset martini !
the food was just not well prepared .
great place keep up the great work !
worst experience of my life !
just do n't expect a magical experience .
this place is a nightmare .
the food was tasty and my dish delicious .
our group of _num_ all loved their food .
i was really dissappointed .
funny to see the last person who reviewed firefly is my brother !
but in reality , i know there will be no outcome from this .
great awesome authentic mexican food .
yes this store is super crowded but the people are really friendly and helpful .
good thing i found some good coupons on groupon .
i ca n't stop crying .
this was the best accident we have ever had !
overall , it was fine and is an ideal location on the strip .
the food was pretty good .
the food was pretty good .
my recommendation , stay elsewhere .
also , the parking is atrocious .
the rooms are outdated and if you want an updated room it cost extra .
the server said to me `` this is mexican soul food !
the whole experience was awful !
adventure dome was fun as usual .
i avoid this place if at all possible .
kinda pricey at _num_ a head to look at some wax statues .
i would n't come here again if it were the last place on earth .
it was big enough to go home and eat some more !
not worth the trip .
they sent me to a manager 's voicemail .
adds to the experience .
chips , salsa and guac were great .
i ordered the shrimp stir fry luncheon for _num_ .
it 's a very disappointing hotel to stay at .
it was so bad that i had to find a different casino to gamble .
service is a little snooty , but it is worth going for the food !
do i need the voice of god telling me there is a fire alarm ?
even this was not cooked all the way .
apparently , management has decided that is not an option .
i had the veggie noodle soup and it was excellent .
great place , great service .
they helped me with my handicap .
going in and out was no problem .
i drove by this local twice before i found it .
just make sure you do n't have any breathing problems .
the food and cocktails are awesome , and the staff is always friendly .
service is excellent and super attentive .
every other casino on the strip was booked .
great little off the strip place to check out .
i 've come here for tapas for years now and still love it .
but the front desk was very efficient !
beautiful room overlooking the fountains .
enjoyed our meal and time here today .
i could not wait to come home to write this review .
jenny and eva are great and their service is what keeps me coming back .
staff was also great !
the best on the strip !
thank you very much !
great drink selection including wines , great prices and good service !
the only edible item in the bag was the fortune cookie !
a great find in the land of corporate dining .
solid martinis , great service , and tons of good options .
ca n't even help a veteran out .
by far , the filet mignon sliders were the best , absolutely amazing !
great place to eat .
driven by the joint for years , finally stopped in .
there is crap everywhere .
_num_ hours later , we walk back , during the cold snap .
her response was that my time starts _num_ minutes before my appointment .
this was so memorable that we had to eat tapas the next night .
the scrambled eggs were watery .
the view outside my room was all brick wall .
great food and atmosphere .
i would not only use them again but recommend them to everyone !
third - the room is not horrible but it 's not great .
at this place the food is tasty .
the drinks are so good.
food and service was great .
go for the sangria too - it 's quite tasty !
the staff is always very friendly and helpful .
nothing drops besides the bills in your wallet .
it was the most vibrant sample spoon ever served to me , ever !
the service is wonderful , and everyone is just very nice there .
thank god we did because we absolutely loved firefly on paradise !
queso fundido comes with freshly made tortillas .
unfortunately i was more than a bit disappointed with flavor .
the osso buco was fantastic , very tender and fell right off the bone .
the pool area was fun for my boys , and myself as well .
the fish and scallop pieces were perfectly cooked and the flavor was spot on .
service was not very good .
try it you will like it !
not my go to anymore , sadly enough .
a great deal for locals with proper id .
the food is really authentic mexican food .
leisurely paced meal which is rare in vegas .
easily one of my favorite places in town .
i recommend eating at this spago location !
the food was average , nothing over the top .
firefly has such a high rating for a reason !
the selection was n't much .
it smells like smoke .
food is awesome and affordable for lv .
tremendous value for las vegas !
well , smelled more like an ash tray now that i remember .
nothing blew me away but a very solid choice overall .
it was good luck and good times .
but kudos to that employee because you are doing a stand up job .
she says `` your room might not be ready !
however the latest experience was not so enjoyable .
our server tina and her team were very attentive and the food was delicious .
housekeeping did a mediocre job .
i 'm a girl i like makeup and i love me some mac products !
really terrible service ... .
anyway , i 'll get to the point .
but i do n't judge a book by its cover .
it was as if she was on medication or something worse .
not much good to say .
this is no man cave it 's a boy cave .
i 've been wanting to try this place for some time .
toilet seats should n't just split apart !
: ) the latest styles and reasonable prices !
how hard is it to wash your vegetables !
the food was amazing .
the food was amazing .
the food was amazing .
they do excellent work and are a joy to deal with .
fyi ... that triple shot game is a tourist trap and a scam .
so i purchased the closest available seats which were around $ _num_ a ticket .
just an assistant of some kind .
i ca n't wait for the other one to open up down the street .
awesome view of the water show and great service .
avoid this place at all cost !
absolutely and unbelievable experience .
we were playing at a slot machine and got ignored by two cocktail waitresses .
no power outlets except for the one in the bathroom .
i ultimately walked away with nothing .
i loved the calamari .
we had such an unpleasant experience i need to warn people .
they are all friendly and cool .
i will stay again .
food was so good !
this ended up not being true , they did have a buffet .
the air conditioning was cold and consistent .
quick , easy access , clean .
the room was a standard hotel room , slightly dated .
madame tussauds is a `` must do '' when going to vegas !
our instructor was very nice , informative , and attentive .
i confirmed that we would be given two beds and we accepted .
the food is good and totally authentic .
really good service as well as dishes and drinks at happy hour .
she was professional and courteous on the phone .
happy hour never lets me down !
upon entering the restaurant , i loved the dcor and the ambiance in general .
* the casino is depressing looking .
his toe got stuck under the bottom , and it sliced his toe .
my friends liked their dishes as well .
so if you 're planning a stay here , request tower i .
love love their sangria and tapas .
price was $ _num_ per night .
teresa and her staff are the best that you can get in las vegas .
let me tell you it 's gone downhill .
but the hotel part was n't as good.
but the hotel not so good not so clean .
once the right dish actually arrived only lack luster can describe the food .
absolutely the worst check in experience of my life .
rooms are nice and have everything a patient will need to feel comfortable .
it 's alright food , i would just rather spend my $ _num_ elsewhere .
i wish i grabbed this young kid 's name working tonight .
the quality is consistently very good and the service is quite good as well .
we really like to eat here when in vegas .
once we were seated we waited again _num_ minutes for our lobster .
she could have saved me an hour trip .
if you want great italian at a better price , go to pasta mia .
no , but the crowd at harrah 's seemed extra scary .
the food was great !
the food was great !
the food was great !
great sangria , great atmosphere , great food .
however , i was impressed with the hotel .
drinks are pretty basic , stick to the menu .
get a reservation and enjoy yourself .
been to vegas so many times and never really stayed at this place .
the front desk told me that i have to check out by 10:30 am !
do n't get me wrong , i 'm all for this .
_num_ minutes at least with no clean up .
i do n't last long , i usually leave .
the food was incredible !
rooms are extremely nice and spacious .
as i said the rooms are small , the windows do n't really open .
there was no balance at all .
we stayed at excalibur for _num_ days the week before christmas .
they took care of me with great customer service from a super friendly staff .
man people are idiots .
best service , and more experienced workers too .
this hotel/casino is not cool .
so that was nice .
the rooms are well worth it and there 's a balcony too .
i had the salmon pasta that came with bread .
the stuff looked like it 'd been sitting there forever .
the dealers were great !
it was delicious , just like everything else i 've ever had there .
i highly recommend it to everyone !
they told me they 'd comp me a night .
overall , it was a bad experience .
pay $ _num_ a week and $ _num_ total to own it .
this is our favorite lunch/dinner place in vegas .
the bad : this is not a hotel for couples .
everything we ordered was delicious , the lamp chops were the best !
the smell when you walk in is overwhelming .
the starbucks in paris has wifi .
this mediocre , at best , restaurant has closed .
the games are quite boring and not many selection .
sandwich was just alright .
it 's an older hotel on the strip but i love it !
tacky , stinky and rude !
then when we got to the room we had little hairs on our towel .
i met my wife here for lunch on the 6th .
bad sign , old !
old and musty smelling room .
love this place off the strip .
excellent service , great food .
best prices for gun rentals and not overly crowded .
overall , i 'm not impressed with the rooms here .
it was around $ _num_ for a friday and saturday night .
the restrooms are fairly gross .
the only issue i have is the toilets or plumbing on the house .
go to the grocery store buy all the stuff and make it at home .
they literally walk around and kick people out of the pool area at _num_ .
one of the best mac stores i have visited .
definitely good for the younger crowd .
fantastic food & service !
it is the equivalent to a run down motel _num_ .
the shrimp ceviche was fresh and yummy .
do yourself a favor and do n't come here .
i 'm sorry but i would n't want to stay here again .
the mattress was worn out and needed to be replaced asap .
at the least they should 've replaced the order at no charge .
this place is dirty and the employees are rude .
checked in early and the front desk were not helpful or friendly at all .
i got a soggy , disgusting pile of trash with cheese and ketchup .
there are much better options on the strip and especially off the strip .
when we left because i know my stuff , and i said everything right .
it was the most romantic setting we could ask for .
this is a true nike lovers disneyland .
as for the sugar cookie , it was really tasty .
she refused to let him in .
definitely worth checking out even if there is nothing to buy .
highly recommend to all !
on tuesday i called the security again around 10am but no answer .
bulbs changed - very satisfied !
i will definitely be back next time i 'm in town .
this place sucks ass .
a beautiful boutique with a very unique selection of clothes and gifts .
all dishes are super tasty !
that works for me .
it 's in a real crappy part of town .
i waited a hour and no one showed up .
two levels : women 's downstairs , men 's upstairs .
too yucky to take pictures .
for being a resort on the strip , i was pretty disappointed .
sears , macy 's , and dillard 's ) .
but , i like the ones from crown bakery in chinatown much better .
also , do not eat at any of the restaurants in excalibur .
actually it is extremely depressing .
this place is mmm mmm good .
truly is satisfaction guaranteed .
both sides of pasta were poor simple as that .
i arrived _num_ minutes later .
they are from chicago so you know their deli food is good !
the monorail is definitely cheaper than a taxi ride .
they have the best mojitos & sangria .
red lobster at decatur and us _num_ .
prompt and friendly service .
soup & salad came out pretty quickly .
our waiter was so attentive and professional , with a calm and kind demeanor .
shitty awful expensive and disappointing .
this hotel seems to be very poorly run .
love coming here for there happy hour every week .
the elevators were awful .
do n't get me wrong , it was really good .
then , she served it in styrofoam containers .
the las vegas location was the first one i tried and i loved it !
they entire staff is professional and so fun .
and the patient is doing well , thank you .
the rooms are nice enough , but with few amenities .
when i got to hotel after driving all day there was no commercial parking .
unfortunately , my experience was this .
tony our instructor was high energy and did a lot with us .
great service and amazing ambience !
i 'm still in shock this has happened .
there are many games including _num_ cent video poker ( my fav ) .
the tables are n't over-priced and the atmosphere is fun .
food was pretty good and the free entertainment was better than i thought .
and a `` canal '' view , too !
i would just work on the smell it smells really bad .
rooms have no mini fridge , microwave , or coffee pot which is inconvenient .
it was horrible ... .
really disappointed in this place .
we normally went to bass pro for our purchased but these guys are great .
kind of ridiculous i thought .
excellent restaurant for breakfast and dinners .
excellent restaurant for breakfast and dinners .
but the beef empanadas were amazing !
personal favorite location is in the planet hollywood .
overall , we really enjoyed the experience !
both events are ideal fun for the whole family .
motel six without the amenities .
unorganized and messy , it 's almost impossible to find anything purchase here .
his pastas have incredible texture and the flavors are simply amazing .
i would argue this is hardly a resort .
the decor of the place is rather quaint as well .
strangely had to ask for menus .
we did n't stay for very long .
the food is fresh and authentic .
service was also great .
uni was brown and it tasted nasty .
i had fun playing the penny and quarter slots here .
the bathroom also was kept up the entire time i was there .
they loved it and the dvd was really well done .
otherwise , the food is awesome and worth the trip off the strip !
as a former server , there 's no excuse for that .
the rooms were quite noisy and not the cleanest either .
this time however , i was severely disappointed .
between 11pm and 6am , your room service food options are ... nothing .
i like fast and friendly service .
i had a good meal here .
that is a woman who has a rich life and knows what is important !
haha , great guy .
fair warning : do n't get it .
i ordered osso bucco so did _num_ of the other _num_ people .
the service was great and so were the drinks .
the atmosphere is chaotic with lots of loud screaming children .
tapas is my absolute favorite , and this place is heavenly .
the tapas are delectable .
a helpful lift up and down the strip .
perfect for a large gathering or romantic dinner date in a comfy corner booth .
our room _num_ reeked of mildew !
i feel bad giving two stars to the excalibur , but it deserves it .
the casino feels old and stinky .
they 're also very inexpensive !
very friendly and has the best customer service ever .
thanks for having a nice facility for us to shoot in !
good location just a few blocks from the strip .
there was no wifi which was thoroughly disappointing .
old world charm and delicious food .
no explanation , just `` you ca n't '' .
so i guess it was ok ... but check this out .
large rooms at a good price .
it 's by far the best place ever .
the room was dirty and several things were broken or in need of maintenance .
if you have kids , you got ta stay here !
i barely would even consider there food edible if starving to death .
great place for tapas .
i guess that 's why excalibur is so cheap .
how many `` bars '' can have that honor ?
found this place while wandering inside the venetian .
we then waited an additional _num_ minutes past the original appointment time .
tv was a bonus for the kids too !
after the shrimp disaster , we asked again about our first order .
overall she was very pleasant .
and the atmosphere is great .
out of all the fat tuesday 's this one is my favorite !
by the way the room service stops at 11:00 pm and the menu sucks !
this was worse than the first time .
they are aggressive and very rude .
they are very rude .
the prices are extremely reasonable and the tapas are really good .
fun and vibrant place that fills up .
the took over _num_ minutes to find me package on back storage .
the sauce was so good !
just expect hard beds , outdated decor and slim options for dining .
their food really went downhill .
they actually laugh at you when you lose money .
a half yard with strawberry margarita or pina colada with an extra shot please .
wonderful job , keep up the good work !
salsa had an amazing flavor and a kick to it .
the food is awesome .
nobody cares about you , they just see you as `` tip money '' .
im not sure which was worse the food or the horrid service .
actually , the rooms at motel _num_ probably would have been nicer .
super convenient and well priced compared to another competitors around the strip !
management or house keeping or security never once checked up on us .
our instructor bob was not only informative but made the experience fun and entertaining .
again , the location is n't that bad .
full cost for resort fees though .
a restaurant changes , they change the sign .
even the bread and butter is good here .
never offered a different bottle , etc .
i absolutely love this place !
called after _num_ minutes and she was extremely rude and dismissive !
good cheap beer and slot machines but stay away from the hot dogs .
bad service , bad management .
we showed him the bed and he returned _num_ minutes later with new sheets .
the pool and spa closes at 6pm .
waitress was super nice and always made sure we had drinks refilled !
the only thing that was pretty good was their egg rolls .
started us off with a nice basket of assorted breads and biscuits .
get a pitcher of sangria or mojito to really make things fun .
it hit the spot .
and the one on the strip next to harrah 's is pretty decent .
the buffet at the excalibur was very cheap _num_ for _num_ ( _num_ ) .
thank you i highly recommend maurice and diamond events !
this is our vegas fuel !
great food and drink .
the food is always great .
not nearly enough napkins were provided for the amount of people that were dining .
it 's my favorite drink !
most of all very rude .
`` she can pay with a check why would you tell her that ? ''
it 's a tapas restaurant so order a variety from the menu and share .
i loved the suite .
she then proceeded to put the menu into the stand without cleaning it .
oh god , i pity him now .
the sheets had holes and stains and the furniture was older than i am .
we definitely will be back .
all come with their house salad and potatoes & vegetables .
i can honestly say that these shoes are the most comfortable shoes ever !
the side dishes arrived at the table for my guests and myself cold .
wo n't be going back .
_num_ ) do they not clean their shot glasses ?
you will love going here esp .
did they ever bother to call us ?
everyone in our group of _num_ or so seemed to have a good time !
the rolls were just ok - there are better places out there .
definitely going back when i get back to vegas .
i could 've easily stolen anything .
stayed here once , for the price i was n't expecting much .
really have received no satisfaction from hotel or risk management firm .
overall , i 've had much better .
both of my dishes were wonderful .
the lady hurt me numerous times .
everything is super delish !
i like this place and it seems very popular .
what a lovely little gem .
i love the strawberry margarita !
good prices and love the atmosphere .
i would not recommend using this place .
we had a very solid experience at spago .
the worst ross i have ever been to .
had a good time tho great people and tall size drinks .
that 's how horrible it is .
i would call this `` the worse denny 's ever '' .
the green tea ice cream tasted artificial .
i love the variety of island dishes .
worst experience in vegas by far !
they were both perfect as well .
great place with good ambience .
good value , and delicious .
i did n't have high expectations coming here anyways .
the room however did n't smell like the rest of the place .
both times my group left happy and satisfied .
i liked this hotel mainly because of the swimming pool for the guests .
probably understaffed for the night .
firefly makes a great pitcher or three .
nicely done , very moist pan seared .
all in all , they nailed it !
the food is good here .
while the sushi was decent , the service was absolutely horrible .
it was possibly the best prepared duck breast i 've ever had anywhere .
god knows i was craving since lunchtime .
the maid went into my jewelry box and stole my earrings .
small little bar with fresh oysters .
service very good and timely .
ultimately , i feel they lied online to get customers in through the doors .
i called housekeeping and they came and cleaned the room fairly quickly .
had a wonderful experience for my first time in a mac store !
chips were crisp , fish was battered and crisp without being oily .
so have booked a room for my son and i for golden nugget instead .
we are going back this april , with our _num_ boys .
you have got to eat this food !
the workers are great and helpful .
this is the best of the best .
called them to get a hardly worn pair of shoes fixed .
the best bread , and free range chicken ever !
i 've never dealt with such rude employees .
some are quite annoying but they never stop !
we came here for dinner during restaurant week and had a great experience .
oh and the chips and salsa was great too !
this is a common food for americans .
update : again , just heard more stuff have been stolen from rooms .
always nostalgic about ny when i grab breakfast here .
not worth an extra star though .
i immediately went to the front desk and demanded a new room .
ive been here three times and it gets worse every time .
the drinks were very good as well .
great little bagel shop with a diner feel .
guess what , they were out of range .
fat tuesdays is a great drinking chain .
i want the old grill master back .
i had the worst experience ever !
guess they did n't learn much from that experience .
_num_ tickets for a mini bottle of bubbles ?
okay , it 's vegas , i can handle that .
must ... go ... back !
my friend and i both got a pasta dish and they were great !
agree with most of the negative reviews i have seen .
_num_ of us each got one of these .
we waited about half an hour to get seated , which was fine .
this restaurant is fantastic .
cheese board spread was tasty as well .
good place for a date day or night .
the layout was very neat and there was a lot of variety .
let me just say , take someone with you if you try it on .
sucks , but it is what is .
if you 're renting a car though , stay away !
to add on the service was not that great either .
bread came out burnt and the sirloin was rare .
well worth the trip and $ !
as for the rest of the store , it 's only ok .
no wifi ( wtf ! )
food , service , and prices were perfect !
for a convention center , i 've had better , much better .
very sparse on any room amenities however the bed was good .
the favors were perhaps too bold for me that i could only eat one .
waited _num_ minutes for a burrito and _num_ tacos in the drive thru .
this store has an excellent selection .
the staff is super friendly too .
my tummy might hurt a little bit but it 's worth it .
i 've stayed at the excalibur twice and the level of service is atrocious .
we wo n't be back .
thank you for a very pleasant experience .
we will not stay here ever again .
the food was very filling but the service was not the best .
but our room had roaches !
my sister had to help me get out of the stupid thing !
by far , the worst , most disgusting hotel i have ever stayed in .
good drinks that are strong and priced right for vegas .
excellent sangria - get a pitcher !
we have stayed at harrahs las vegas a half dozen times .
my room was average with two queen beds .
krispy kreme upstairs makes it less painful .
everything is super yummy !
when i asked for more , they all of a sudden ran out .
it was great that they offered free half an hour circus shows .
well the fat older lady just completely lost it .
everything was full of amazing flavor !
the steak was cooked perfect ( medium rare ) and the service was great .
such a waste of insurance money .
which is nice to see your friends jump with you .
our sever jesus greeted us right away and made some fantastic recommendations .
do not go to this show even if you have a free ticket .
the food is always good , inexpensive and easy to get to .
the monorail was clean and easily got us to our destinations .
i love walking around the shops .
definitely better than the other rooms we had paid the same price for previously .
every thing we ate was cold in the middle .
the sauce was ok , and the ingredients were flat .
got a full bikini wax for the first time .
excellent , friendly service !
i wish i could give this _num_ stars for that alone .
besides the tiny margarita we got , everything else was great !
my horror story does n't end with this .
the sales associates were very helpful .
you have to like sweet coffee , but it was soooooo good !
a nice flight of tequila to start things off .
not normally a tapas person but i was very pleasantly surprised by it .
our table was not clean .
we were seated immediately , great service , and delicious food .
beef empanadas were freaking delicious .
it was a nice hotel room and very clean .
this place is disgusting .
this place is disgusting .
if you are looking for a pizza place , do not order from here .
i found the owner and staff to be very personable and helpful .
the casino is in a bad location , so far from the central strip .
my boys had so much fun .
also no fridge or microwave .
cold food after a long wait .
they were so lovely and patient !
we have been loyal to harrah for over _num_ years .
the staff is rude and very lazy .
these guys were super !
he did n't try to accommodate and was n't polite about it at all .
the staff did n't know my insurance after being there three times .
it 's an outlet .
mediocre at the best .
this is a good place .
next time , i 'd probably splurge a little more on a nicer hotel .
still great breakfast and good value in a sketchy shopping strip .
great food and very flavorful !
my group decided on harrah 's for its location and relatively low room rates .
this was an amazing restaurant .
i love that about my doctor .
unfortunately , all good things apparently must come to an end .
check out the one also in the mgm .
brandon the executive chef is amazing !
our room was clean , but the furniture was in need of replacement .
if i 'm paying around $ _num_ a sandwich i want it hot .
really enjoyed the evening .
wine glass was dirty , but service was superb .
the food and customer service was beyond top notch .
_num_ for room service , the food was actually awesome .
i would definitely recommend it .
as a result , i 've booked to stay elsewhere .
assuming water was added because it was not that hot .
they were sick for three days with it .
the staff were nice so okay we gave it a shot .
our room was robbed some time after 5pm yesterday .
so another friend ordered a side of fruit , which we never got .
she is warm and have an amazing eye for beauty .
the security is inept .
mojitos are very good .
i went back to the decatur store on may _num_ .
no big deal , right ?
i will be back for years to come !
they stated they put a bag over it and ran it through the carwash .
he is kind , very straight forward and to the point .
as someone from the philly area , driving by had me pretty excited .
not many people actually shop here , but just walking through is exciting .
the tub was very cozy !
will definitely be back to try some of their drinks .
this location has been nothing but a huge hassle .
i would not suggest staying here if you can afford better .
the variety was a nice touch .
the food is pretty tasty .
great seats outside the forum .
are n't they making enough money off the casino ?
thought it was delicious .
ordered _num_ burgers and boy were they spicy and salty !
amazing atmosphere and delicious food !
we had to ask another waiter after _num_ mins to get our drinks .
overall , i was not happy that we had to stay at this hotel .
it knocked it down to about $ _num_ .
extremely rude staff member .
good price , room was actually nicer than i had expected .
store manager made my bad experience a worst one for sure .
it has the best vibe , best service and best food .
this was definitely our favorite thing we did !
had a great little dinner here with friends .
the low ceiling and poor lighting are kind of depressing .
i should n't even give this place a star !
pricier dishes but definitely worth it in my opinion .
the starbucks in harrahs does not .
i would like to give them _num_ .
all cars come with a two month , _num_ mile power train warranty .
the service is great and not pushy at all .
when we are in vegas with the family this is my go to spot .
good for kids with pool and bath tubs .
( my mother-in-law said the flowers were beautiful . )
the staff is incredibly friendly too .
gold star for brandon , our server , thank you !
the fish here was not fresh !
you just wo n't feel welcome at all for being there .
light , delicious , and right outside the casino .
8th floor and room _num_ . ''
that was my fault but i hate to break the flow of a meal .
i ended ordering a couple of things for friends at work .
there are not enough waitresses .
fat tuesday seemed like the best place to go !
we walk in and they take _num_ minutes for a server to show up .
first trip and first yelp , but highly impressed .
the buffet was awful , with price outrageous .
come here and take a refreshing break from the strip .
loved the monorail and had no problems with tickets or anything .
our service was top grade .
not going there again .
fourth , everything tasted warm but on the cold side .
whats the point if you cant use it anywhere in the casino .
leave a bit of room for dessert as the pastry chef is amazing !
resort fees were indeed included , as well as upgrade fees .
but _num_ minutes later , we get the tomato juice ?
i came here for lunch with my girlfriends .
each course 's wine pairing felt like a natural compliment .
won $ _num_ bucks and ran to the buffet .
i thought it was overpriced and a waste of time .
yummy big drinks , this place is great !
there was no refrigerator , microwave , or coffee maker .
( i certainly wish i did ! )
my experience at excalibur was average at best .
i liked that they have a lot of nickel machines to play slots .
all the sangria 's are good and they will give you a good buzz .
this place if awful .
excalibur has a pretty confusing layout actually despite seemingly being a square .
drinks are expensive like every where else in vegas .
definitely nice for people watching .
a great light dessert before dancing the night away in vegas .
the extra shot is just $ _num_ and definitely worth it .
the heat you will not use alot cause its hardly freezing outside !
the atmosphere was great and the service was excellent .
the selection of stores here is only average .
the excalibur certainly was not that place .
try the steak and mushroom skewers , amazing !
she said that was not her job .
super fast free wifi .
we had an excellent stay at the circus circus .
no lie i waited _num_ .
the good part is it does n't have an casino full with cigarette smoke .
_num_ minutes later she came to ask another question .
resort fee is ridiculous ( $ _num_ ) , you get nothing for it .
the cuban sandwiches are amazing .
i definitely will come back with my friends when i 'm in town .
was in two different rooms , neither had internet available .
great ratio of seafood and veggies .
if it was n't for the free offers i would n't stay here !
what a great night out , we will be back !
if you 're getting free room offers , this is an okay hotel .
this hotel does n't offer anything for a business traveler ... go elsewhere !
i love seating in the upstairs bar .
the other person 's luggage was in the hallway too ... .
just about everything here is understaffed .
at this point , i was at my limit .
nothing special for $ _num_ .
it did open up nicely and improved as the meal went on .
a caesar salad $ _num_ for a sit down breakfast $ _num_ .
i was promised biscuits each time the server came , but alas !
both locations are amazing !
it feels like you went back to the 70s .
well im learning the hard way how bad it is .
i spent so much money to play in this casino .
they want _num_ minutes of your time and $ _num_ deposit .
the sliders were good as well as the calamari and sashimi .
not to mention , it tasted more like crab meat than it did scallops .
they are very strict & safe about visitors .
there is something for everyone here .
lovely location on the canal .
and it was really really slimy inside .
the tapas are creative and delicious !
the monorail is very convenient especially during the hot summer months .
in regards to the piano bar , it is always fun .
this was the biggest waste of money ever !
that even included drinking water .
great bagels , best i 've ever had !
alize is the biggest disappointment in las vegas .
the service was wonderful , the prices were reasonable , and the food !
the cocktails are great here and the happy hour deals are wonderful !
really are you kidding me ?
memory of a lifetime .
i 'm sick of this shit .
there is a varied menu of tasty tapas with something for everyone .
sangria smooth and tapas so good .
worst hotel i have ever stayed at .
worst hotel i have ever stayed at .
do n't waste your money and tip money at this place .
highly recommend to all .
i 'd recommend this place .
the food was amazing , we ordered all sorts and every dish was delicious .
we got a lot more than we thought we would for the price .
worth it to me !
as you can imagine i am pissed .
great food , excellent location , stellar service !
so i stayed here last weekend from thursday to sunday .
did n't realize i did n't get it until i started driving away already .
another issue once in the room at harrahs was the ac .
with tax my total bill was $ _num_ not counting a tip .
the caribou coffee is outstanding .
i really enjoyed my dinner at spago .
got the bbq pork soup with wonton .
1st off , the history of this place alone is worth the visit .
we had fantastic service , and were pleased by the atmosphere .
everything about it was bland .
well for a free ride , it certainly was n't bad at all !
this is how they they deal with battered owners .
thanks again to the great staff !
it was definitely pricey though !
it is the perfect place for kids .
the menu did not have anything very adventurous , in fact quite the opposite .
great bolognese and good atmosphere for people watching !
very disappointed in the room .
toilet would n't flush properly .
we are vegetarians , do n't eat any meat other than fish .
i absolutely loved the presentation of the oysters .
it was really unbelievable some of the stuff he said .
the food is consistently good and the service has always been wonderful .
yes , lori i will keep following up until .
every trip i buy the _num_ hour pass and it 's well worth it .
star reviews do n't make sense to me .
honestly , i was asked that at least _num_ times in two days .
enjoyed the sample of tomato soup .
this place is a hidden gem !
the `` fried shrimp '' was breaded with panko .
the atmosphere is so inviting , and relaxing .
after our wedding , i noticed that one of the diamonds fell out .
do pairs , go in groups , just do n't walk by yourself .
he would n't listen rolled his eyes and was beyond rude .
we came for late night happy hour .
their lobster stuffed mushroom is simply delightful !
i 'll give this one the number _num_ spot for worse denny 's .
our service was fantastic , the food was delicious .
mac and cheese is very good .
the hotel itself was mediocre .
worst `` premium '' room ever .
this hotel seriously needs an upgrade tho ... .
sunrise and the lovely staff have earned a patient the other hospital lost !
nothing terrible , just no reason to go back .
brenda in the office is a doll .
highly recommend this activity when visiting vegas .
it took me the entire trip to figure out my way around .
service is usually good .
harrah 's is in a great location right in the heart of the strip .
but , we had a view of the brick wall of a tower .
service was prompt and attentive .
very hard to choose what i wanted , menu is great .
there falafel and calamari were so delicious and fresh .
i did not have a view so not much to note there .
i 'm extremely disappointed .
wow ... the food was fantastic .
yet there was nothing wet inside the car .
the specialty cocktails were awesome and rounded out our great lunch .
they used american cheese , no option for cheddar , swiss , etc .
i would not recommend this hotel to anyone !
great place for shopping , dining and late night fun .
the wait staff and bartenders are rude .
i come here for happy hr all the time , i love it !
room service '' , an awful sound at 9am .
they where not offered assistance in any form .
and was very helpful and knowledgeable with helping me understand `` the lines . ''
there was a light bulb missing in one of the lights .
i will definitely order one in the future .
not to mention that the tv channels suck .
only gave _num_ stars because they sprayed our room and have a refund .
the service was fast & prompt and there food was delivered pretty efficiently .
at this point i am just hoping things are clean .
they were never sent out to be fixed and no one had called me .
we will definitely be back .
we will definitely be back .
we will definitely be back .
we will definitely be back .
our food was great !
normally the fee is $ _num_ per day .
inside there 's a wide variety of shops , restaurants and of course gambling .
a great tapas restaurant !
yeah i do n't recommend staying here ever .
best margarita i have ever had .
that 's ridiculous and just wrong .
a good chance to experience a variety of flavors without stuffing yourself silly .
please do not eat at the buffet .
they were extremely nice and made it worth it to play there !
i wasted my time and money coming here .
amazing sangria , great tapas , good looking people .
stuffed eggplant and meatballs were good .
service is tremendously slow .
the room is super clean and comfy .
there is no tub , it 's just a stand up shower .
honestly , i had no choice .
cool place , mellow .
it seems like it was at least _num_ pages long !
plenty of equipment , without somebody standing right right next to you .
no one offered to comp my room .
the internet is horrible .
the enchiladas are rich and delicious .
we will definitely go back !
easy access to all of the strip and a tram to other casinos .
calamari : very crispy and comes with a delicious dipping sauce .
i usually sit in the bar and the bartenders are friendly and attentive .
seriously , this place has easily become our favorite restaurant .
great food and service and great wine list .
excellent margaritas , chips and salsa and guacamole .
i got a gel manicure and a spa pedicure .
it was so delicious !
it 's a super super awesome good time .
fresh , colorful , and perfect flavor .
next time i will not be staying at this hotel .
i really want to say nice things about polo towers .
the best flavor in my opinion is the _num_ octane .
_num_ minutes went by again , no first round .
wo n't be coming back here to dine .
i love this place !

cons : no room in the entire hotel has a bathtub .
my favorite : bellini !
did not bring _num_ items ordered .
the most friendly and informative staff .
food was soo good and service from tina was superb .
simply unacceptable in my eyes .
firefly , i 'll be back soon !
one of my favorite places to eat in town .
after the specials were presented _num_ entrees were selected .
the buffet is horrible .
the bathroom floor was not clean .
there is no safe and small fridge .
the sangria is also amazing .
the price is decent too .
the decor was old and drab .
i 'm so done staying here .
i would never step foot in this filthy casino again .
they seem to have a great community and know all their regular customers well .
then our third they lost our vehicle key at the bell desk .
valet was n't the greatest .
excellent food , excellent wine selection !
i was not surprised at the other places and their negative reviews !
i understand = i do n't care .
this place reminds me of a motel _num_ in a castle form .
the employees are always really nice and the food is amazing !
very expensive for a sandwich with very little meat and even less cheese .
we went back outside and waited another _num_ minutes ... still no one .
stay away if you have moderate standard requirements .
as my first meal in vegas , i was pleasantly surprised with circo !
i 've had several items , all were average .
so happy to find this place .
when i come back to vegas i wo n't be coming back here again .
_num_ tvs on sports channels and some video poker inside .
overall , i loved it and we will definitely going back here .
perfect place to dine alone at the bar .
the buffet was superb , although i was too hungover to fully enjoy it .
the worst meal ever !
stayed friday and saturday night there this weekend .
it was overall cooked perfectly but very bland .
bellini is the best flavor !
uni was not great .
it is a must go to when i hit up vegas !
quick service , neat island style decor .
god bless the monorail !
air quality is poor .
ok ... my issue is not the fact that they need to update .
they have let themselves totally go down the toilet .
first off this rating is based on the horrible food service scene here .
she gave me no paperwork to sign or anything .
it 's upscale comfort food at its best .
really cute family-owned restaurant .
it 's been _num_ minutes and no food yet !
terrific place for a date !
the food was ok , nothing crazy delicious .
she 's rude as hell .
everything on their extensive tapas menu is great .
is the slowest , most unprofessional place i have ever been .
the crowd is young and attractive .
four of us had a great meal at spago !
the sides were ice cold a mashed potatoes & grilled carrot & greens .
the worst online shopping experience ever !
came here with my husband for breakfast and it was great !
do n't even bother setting one toe in the door at that place .
it is a nice hotel off the strip .
make a reservation , though !
teller said wait for an officer .
plus the decorations and the ceiling are very nice .
loved the beef tar tar appetizer .
- filet mignon sliders ( delicious ! )
i called the front desk again , they assured they had called security .
i will definitely visit there when i 'm next in vegas !
all the service here is great .
completely run down and stinks horribly .
above par food and drink for a vegas mexican restaurant .
the food is not even authentic .
you can not check into the hotel until 3pm .
nice `` at home '' feel while you 're on vacation .
unbelievable that the offered us two different table across the room from each other !
i will never stay here again and will tell everyone else not to either .
it 's definitely worth the drive here for the steakhouse alone .
the salmon she ordered was n't fully cooked !
i have never been so disrespected in my entire life .
i do n't know why so many insurance companies have her as a provider .
he was so fun to talk to and made our decisions easy .
takes up the corner spot in a large shopping center , big parking lot .
almost yellow in color , smells nasty and the meat is just little bit .
wow this place is soooo fun !
took my daughter down to the arcade .
however , i apparently waited to long .
it is dirty and the clientele leaves a lot to be desired .
worth making the trip off the strip for !
then housekeeping never came to clean the rooms .
it was creamy and perfectly cooked .
very soothing colors and cloth napkins for your hands !
it was good , what you would expect .
karen provided amazing service .
the sangria was good and the tapas were even better .
i will not be shopping there any more ... their loss !
check in line was slow ... total rewards was a mess .
- the lobster `` escargot '' was terrible !
out of the four dinners , not one of us was satisfied .
i highly recommend this place !
i highly recommend this place !
i highly recommend this place !
the menu is not extensive but it is very delicious .
my favorite bagel shop in las vegas .
from the minute you walk in it will be regret if you stay here .
she did n't want to stay at harrahs anymore .
change your service or get the heck out of hospitality business !
* no reservations at bar .
so happy and delighted with them .
i could n't even taste the meat !
i did not like this hotel at all .
lie to us and then stick us in a gross room .
stayed at this hotel twice now .
also it was more expensive than before .
the dish as a whole was superb !
these guys are just of the strip and worth the trip .
find another place just off strip .
its a fun , loud place with great food !
thank you we will be back !
worse customer service ever !
new cooks , place sucks now .
another great meal at bahama breeze !
they were pleased with their meals as well - we all cleaned our plates .
would not come back .
great location next to the canal .
my boyfriend and i ordered chips with salsa and guacamole ( sooo good ) .
the pool is beautiful and refreshing .
i love the salami and eggs .
so here is an update , _num_ months later .
so here is an update , _num_ months later .
the worst hotel ive ever stayed in .
also loved the bread pudding and chocolate tres leches for dessert .
the staff is great and quick at making my drinks .
when i came on saturday , they sent me right to an upgraded room .
there is no wifi .
the food was n't necessarily phenomenal but all of the dishes were good .
thus , no business for them .
i am not impressed with this restaurant .
we chose this place after reading yelp reviews and were very happy we did !
honestly not _num_ single complaint !
i came on a weekday after the lunch rush and enjoyed fast service .
officially my last visit to one of these !
so far , the longest i have had to wait is about _num_ hour .
their sangria was amazing !
made us wait _num_ minutes for our check and box .
our server was friendly and efficient .
okay , great , but i 'm here for take-out .
good food great atmosphere love it here !
kinda sad soggy fries .
at first , i did n't mind paying for the drinks .
the place is incredibly romantic .
had a smoothie , and nearly died it was so good .
the chips and salsa are very good .
i did n't even stay here .
i love this place - one of my top _num_ restaurants ever .
this will go down as an all-time treat .
there was no fridge .
my room smelled like raw sewage .
i went to _num_ different ross las vegas locations looking for the sleep set .
when you come in smells like some one die in it !
the manager was a tall man , bald and was not sympathetic at all .
would n't stay here again .
oh , and all towels smelled of mildew .
well worth the investment !
the thermostat did n't work .
great selection of tapas and awesome sparkling sangria !
the food was so good that i decided to start writing reviews on yelp .
the service was great although the place was packed !
i had mixed feelings about the other features of the hotel .
would stay again , and hopefully get better service .
i cut them off and told them i was not interested in that garbage .
food good and wine list extensive .
cocktails hit the spot at 3-4 $ happy hour .
_num_ ) room is ok .
attendants on duty so that 's good and they are friendly and helpful .
desk staff was awesome and helpful .
great happy hour deals on house margaritas .
take them to a better and friendlier place .
i 've never given a hotel just _num_ star before .
stayed here _num_ times altogether .
it was a little bitter for my taste .
2nd time i went .
parking is not included in the $ _num_ resort fee !
the flautas were delicious .
i 'm always surprised this place is still in business .
i will definatly be back if i ever need to do this again .
found out via other yelpers !
in all honesty , i 'd prefer my _num_ minutes back .
i just had my wedding reception there and the food and atmosphere is amazing !
all the bread and pastas are made in house and are so delicious .
i explained my situation and was shown _num_ cars .
had a fantastic lunch here .
service is excellent too .
expanded shoe and jewelry selection .
the pasta dish was delicious .
decided to stop here for some late night eats after a night spent downtown .
they were amazingly good .
this is the worst denny 's i 've ever been to .
i 'd recommend it .
something as simple as the parmesan fries with aioli are amazing .
pool : what a dump !
i guess it 's ok if you do n't mind the old vibe .
the slots did n't pay out for us at all .
but that has already been said .
harrahs scores high from me .
great food , wonderful staff and fun atmosphere .
i was very dissatisfied with the room .
stood in tower _num_ , needs to updated badly .
you are right smack in the middle of the vegas strip .
needless to say we wo n't recommend or every stay at the excalibur again .
sadly excalibur is no exception .
the sangria is by far the best in town .
this is a great find for both locals and visitors .
our room was located in the 25th floor in tower _num_ .
server was alright not that she was great but she was n't bad .
def try breakfast here and the bagels are the best in town !
we enjoy this place , so we keep coming back .
everything i had was excellent !
came here for a cocktail and light lunch during our most recent trip .
high top tables with high chairs .
firefly is always packed and i have never had a bad meal here .
in short , i do not recommend this show .
the turkey burger looked , tasted , and felt like leftover meatloaf .
the guac was delicious and the view amazing .
we arrived at 12:30 noon to an absolutely empty restaurant .
nice service nice quality nice atmosphere , will come back again .
this place has been around a long time and is really good .
standing around chit chatting asked for a host _num_ times !
everything always fresh and made to order .
i 've always loved bahama breeze and this location is no exception .
the service is fast and attentive .
when i arrived the shop had _num_ other people , so not busy .
in all of my life i have not seen this before .
lots of plus size options , which is extremely rare !
the staff is helpful and very positive .
wonderfully sized for a room with _num_ queen beds .
no one ever asked though .
they have the best sangria hands down .
but sadly , i will not stay in the hotel here again .
the food and menu looks like it has n't changed in _num_ years .
bagels was n't the best i 've had .
they were not busy at all still took so long to get me started .
seriously , get rid of these clowns !
worse still , harrah 's seems to be the only one .
the mac and cheese was also delicious .
really , the most thorough museum tour i 've ever done .
this lack of competition also makes them not care about marketing .
housekeeping is so loud .
it would have been a better experience to do it myself at home .
if i could give this dump a zero i would !
i must say , i am glad we only ordered _num_ plates .
the pasta option i ordered for dinner was well done and damn tasty .
the beers were pretty yucky anyway so i did n't care .
the casino staff is more helpful than the hotel staff .
the bartender , aaron , is awesome !
the guy working , cesar , was so unbelievably rude .
they made the situation like it was our fault .
they made the situation like it was our fault .
well worth the price !
there is no actual street access .
not necessarily flavorful - but humongous .
the clientele in the casino were very creepy .
i wish it was possible to give `` _num_ '' stars .
they said they could accommodate us , no problem .
i am very disappointed .
i am very disappointed .
my meal at firefly was the best in vegas by far .
it smelled like old motel .
point is do not waste time on this place !
the bartenders are really nice and quick .
i however , mind and will not be staying here ever again .
one of my favorite restaurants in vegas for sure !
the food is okay but expensive for vegas .
excellent service , nice atmosphere , good food , and great drinks .
reasonable prices , centrally located on the strip and friendly staff .
i think for the price that groupon offered , its very well worth it .
best bang for your buck , and they taste great too !
the tapas were great , ceviche was amazing .
and the service is always top notch .
without even asking , they brought me edamame and miso soup .
and it 's fun .
my husband , visited the store earlier this morning to get our family breakfast .
i do not recommend nor will i ever use them in the future .
an enormous place that has everything you could possibly want .
the guy was really nice .
im not sure i would have finished my orders .
but i had the worse experience ever .
great menu and great atmosphere .
i do n't know how the workers can work here .
the bagel was good .
located inside ph miracle mile and a quick and affordable stop for a treat .
which makes sense of all the trash !
we had to do that ourselves and had a great time .
this was a mistake .
nice gesture but this is not a welcome pack .
our tower _num_ room had a view of the monorail .
i walked in here twice .
the wait is almost always a minimum of _num_ hours .
i have a sleep numbers bed .
just a blanket with two sheets around it .
we sat at the bar with an extraordinary bartender named emily .
the veal shank ( osso bucco ) was fork tender but bland .
she does n't typically like cheese steak sandwiches .
orange juice is fresh squeezed and coffee is good .
i took my gf here and it was good dining experience .
but the food was also really good !
it 's not even worthy of a star .
yummy food and tasty sangria !
reminds me of islands back home .
just the worst ever .
i highly recommend this store and their outstanding staff .
excalibur hotel is a giant , cheap motel .
service was good enough .
turkey club sandwich rates a very good !
this was on december 8th _num_ .
we sat in the bar and we had a piss poor server .
besides the low price , there 's nothing really special about the hotel .
she was just absolutely terrible .
so yes , you could very easily get your entre $ _num_ cheaper .
do n't gamble on your place to stay .
i should have talked to a manager .
and plus , it 's just bad for business .
the happy hour is absolutely fabulous .
i had a marvelous dining experience here !
will i go back , maybe if someone else buys .
a fairly miserable night for $ _num_ more than the original price .
i 'll pay top dollar for food- if it 's worth it .
i would be very very careful about going back there .
overall good experience and would recommend .
i love it here !
needed a cool refreshing snack after doing a small hike .
happy hour is from 4-6 pm monday - friday .
it was worth it .
but it is all really good and a great neighborhood breakfast and lunch joint .
ambiance - positive two stars
i mixed the margarita and mango and that was good .
it 's not authentic , and it does not have a great menu offering .
i guess i was wrong .
i had the shrimp , avocado and crab tower and it was delicious !
every thing else sucks .
great view of the fountains .
the casino is nothing special .
the service is always attentive .
we had an awesome time !
all the food was tasty and fresh .
the sangria is good but i prefer the mojito better .
but it was a cool experience .
but they could n't with harrah 's terrible wifi .
the best tapas restaurant i have ever been to .
excalibur , not a fan .
leave me alone . '
the food is crap at best and inconsistent all the time .
words can not describe the disappointment i feel .
in reading other reviews it seems that this is not out of the ordinary .
my hubby and i really really like this place .
it was the perfect choice .
firecracker shrimps , spinach dip , sesame crusted ahi ... soooo delicious !
i put the sun chips back , the female employee was right there .
do not do business with these people .
my wife and i had been here years before and enjoyed it .
hoping for another customer service representative ( nope ! )
so i booked this hotel for the same reason that most do .
i 'd take the kids back for sure , it was a cool experience .
they said they could not find me and ran it through the car wash .
room smelled like pissed & the sheets were dirty .
i ate the most amazing set of crab claws from florida .
it was not the worst but there is far better .
red sangria is very nice with lots of apple in it .
this place was really good .
the rooms are all old but for the price i guess you cant complain .
i went to lunch with some coworkers .
this was some of the best food and service we 've ever received .
firefly fries were pretty delicious too .
the site to store has certainly been a hit and miss .
i loved this place .
i loved this place .
avoid that tower at all cost !
the cheap prices are not worth it .
oh ... there they are ... sitting in the window .
we won a lot of stuffed animals and it was fun .
needless to say my meal is always more enjoyable when this is the case .
their service was very quick and friendly .
save the best for last .
why make an appointment if you do n't honor them ?
i am going to try to never have to stay here again.
could n't seem to ever get valet to park the darn car .
it 's like a fine wine .
me and my fiance stayed here while we were wedding venue hunting .
service had been great for the times we went .
would n't come here if you paid me .
the rooms were outdated and kind of smelled .
clearly vegas is trying to shake their `` family friendly '' image .
every time , the fish is cooked perfectly and the service impeccable .
overall everything was good .
great store with great employees , and the prices are good too !
this is no big deal .
went late and had park in back and hope i did n't get towed .
wow what a way to celebrate in vegas .
i also tried what my friends had ordered and everything was tasty !
- mediocre sushi at best .
i know granted i was wearing casual clothing , but i do not steal .
he was n't pleasant & barely even spoke .
it was to hot in there i could n't sleep .
manager was rude as well .
but the club is clean and well equipped .
great food and great service .
change it & you might just drive better business .
what a waste of time .
i honestly did not know you could mess up scallops .
i then realized the penny was the fix !
this really is a great shop .
no room service after _num_ pm .
love it for the chicken entree and pizza !
thanks for the shitty sake !
clean store , solid customer service .
its $ _num_ per night !
now this is what we crave everyday !
considering the prices i would never return to this establishment for any reason .
this stay proved that to be the case in the hotel areas as well .
the bartender just placed _num_ different open bottles on the bar to look at .
this place is fantastic !
now for the biggest problem of all .
i always order when i visit !
great food and service from frank .
that cost $ _num_ extra , each plate .
check in was bad .
nothing in room a stained old chair desk beds and tv .
every employee that we ran into was nice !
the piano players were fun , and they knew ever song that was requested .
i really enjoyed the ceviche .
while the server was nice and polite the food was horrible .
circus circus seems cleaner .
i did n't sleep the whole time i was there .
for that type of service , the food was overpriced .
i 'll be going back again , and again .
i wo n't stay there again .
i wo n't stay there again .
we went as a group of five and loved the atmosphere .
to hell with this place .
the concierge desk was the only highlight to this trip .
the food was excellent , across the board .
most bullshit business ever !
nice ( but pricey ) shops .
i have stayed in a much better motel _num_ .
by the way , the butt stayed there for _num_ days .
overall our stay sucked !
a little out dated and the air quality is n't the best .
refilled out drinks consistently ... .
no wifi , but i absolutely do not care .
so i went without water in the desert .
all very good : ) i will be back .
we should 've ordered another one because we loved all the little desserts .
this meant sending the food back and waiting for it to be cooked again .
ordered a makers mark whiskey sour , enjoyed that too .
this place does n't care about you at all .
stay away from entree because the tapas are usually delicious .
this is the best hospital to have baby .
the doc office had an issue with the lab they sent my x-ray to .
the good : plenty of parking in this strip mall _num_ .
front desk , are you asleep ?
it was very very good .
we ordered an amazing prosciutto pizza .
she wished me a happy birthday and even gave me a flower !
eva did a wonderful job .
they made my birthday fun , special , and not super expensive .
simply had no good taste of flair at all .
chevy told them is losing pressure in motor .
have a yourself a good time .
ate a late dinner there and had excellent enchiladas !
the bed was comfy , the tv was nice , overall very clean .
my friends were also very satisfied with their dishes .
i would def recommend this place to any and everyone !
all in all , i see no reason to give them a 5th chance .
the food was great , the service wonderful , the place was clean .
the coconut shrimp are awesome !
we always come here at least once during our vegas trips .
skip this expensive place .
but nothing like this .
service was friendly , fast , and unobtrusive .
fabulous top notch service , we were even given a local 's discount .
the most fun you can have in las vegas with you clothes on .
its such a mess !
great bahama drinks , great food , great live music !
food was good , room was clean , casino was nicer than i expected .
sometimes there 's a wait but that 's because it 's sooooo good !
get to room and it does not look newly renovated .
you can get a over priced haircut elsewhere .
i said he could give me a coupon for something off .
i said he could give me a coupon for something off .
they are slow , rude and overpriced .
you should make a visit when you 're in vegas !
, so the excalibur fit the bill .
but i 've been in worse hotels .
an upbeat group of folks .
for desert we tried the flan , which was unique and super tasty .
the worst hotel i 've ever stayed !
a great place to browse if you have more time than money .
what a great experience .
the lobster bisque did not have a strong enough lobster flavour .
i do n't leave trash on the inside and take good care of it .
they accommodated us last minute for a party of fifteen so that was nice .
not even an offer of a phone book or anything .
i would not refer anyone to this car lot .
our stay at harrah 's was a big disappointment .
i think their ny strip is the finest in las vegas .
everyone was great and helpful !
very well chosen colors and pieces .
absolutely would stay here again , one of the best deals on the strip !
the buffet was terrible as well .
the big problem is actually eating there .
so i came with them this time .
excellent food ... everything in the menu is great .
i do n't recommend & wo n't be back !
it made chuck e cheese look like a luxurious spa destination .
it was very good !
this is ridiculous and very wrong .
great location right smack in the middle of the strip .
the eggplant was so little , could barely taste it .
worst customer service ever ever ever .
my kids had the most amazing time there today .
shared the fried wontons which were really good .
a lot of reviews talked about spinach raviolis in cream sauce .
if there was a zero star i would use it.
i went downstairs to print out my boarding passes on a paid terminal .
the duck haunts me , it is so sweet , moist , almost beautiful .
will stay here again .
definitely will come back again and again when i am in vegas .
you and your staff have helped our smiles remain beautiful .
the helicopter ride was fun and exciting !
ambiance was wonderful - sat outside .
the food in the cafeteria is pretty tasty for being a hospital cafeteria .
i just love love love my personal shopper ... .
the ambiance and the service were incredible !
this does n't take a manager , just training .
stayed in the mardi gras tower on the 16th floor .
the service was friendly and quick too .
i was overall satisfied with my visit .
they treat vegas locals good .
we arrive and there are _num_ front desk windows open .
great prices great drinks and the dollar shots are a great deal !
there is no wireless internet in the hotel .
finally she hands me the confirmation that it sent .
the lunch burgers and pizza are good .
loved everything about this place .
i would avoid this place at all costs .
my fianc and i decided to check out bags and just walk around .
came here for lunch and enjoyed how fresh the food was .
always great food when i 'm in vegas .
the restaurant was n't very crowded at all for a friday evening at 7pm .
great entertainment at the bar on friday and saturday nights .
the hotel itself was n't even worth it .
calls does n't take several days to pull .
worst car dealership ever .
staff provides great customer service .
great , simple transportation -- if -- it goes where you want .
cooked perfectly , still juicy inside and a great sauce .
finally , the filet mignon was absolutely delicious .
my husband and i left vegas with lots of back pain !
definitely a great place for spanish tapas off the strip .
many of the more popular games are $ _num_ or $ _num_ per person .
it was pretty empty when we came .
i loved the food and drinks .
excellent place to kill time !
btw , do n't get in the water !
i emailed them about my horrible experience and no one replied .
great deal would stay here again .
so we requested more and when it came , it smelt like smoke .
the lunch special for $ _num_ was worth it .
the stuffed dates are delicious .
ate here two nights in a row .
it was so dry and flavorless .
the room and furniture were old and low quality amenities in the rooms .
we left the excalibur feeling rather sad .
amazing staff thank you again for all your care !
so i lucked out and got an artist all to myself !
great food and also nice inside .
it is just not worth it .
just save yourself the headache and go to the walgreens across the street .
there was a tv in the bathroom but there was no remote to it .
i went in at _num_ am on a thursday .
beds were comfy , but no coffee pot in room .
definitely check it out whenever you see one .
we wo n't be staying there again .
the garlic fries were to die for !
being ugly in decor is one thing .
could n't wait to get back to my hotel after this !
overall , a good choice for a less spendy meal in vegas .
stayed here during a meeting i had for work .
_num_ small pieces of fish wrapped around stuffing , _num_ pieces of lobster !
it was piss poor .
is was very disappointing .
my boyfriend and i both asked it in complete horror .
it 's very tropical and relaxing .
very disappointed this time .
even my kids refused to have their burgers !
even checking out is not accommodating .
lovely atmosphere in here , fun shopping .
so the rating can be explained either way .
worst of the worst in customer satisfaction .
no coffee maker either .
it 's pricey but worth every penny .
will definitely eat here again the next time i am in las vegas !
until then , i would not stay here again .
everyone had the best attitude and courtesy i have experienced from a casino .
not for fee and not for free .
the casino is large though .
perfect spot in the forum shops .
contemporary means updated ( does n't it ? )
so ladies , just leave the heels at home .
it is not really cheap , but , they make it look that way .
thanks but no thanks .
i found pills under my bed , there was soap stuck in the shower .
_num_ min to check in .
really amazing food ... .
thanks to circo for a delicious high-end vegas dinner !
definitely coming back to get another one next time !
the doors do not close all the way unless pushed or pulled .
the extra shot will do you some good .
the most disgusting hotel on the strip .
both were amazingly delicious !
great food , atmosphere and service .
the empanadas were delicious as well .
but have enjoyed everything else .
my squid was really good , and birthday cheesecake was very tasty !
the staff at the spa was young , snotty , and ghetto .
it 's simple and very affordable .
when we got to our room _num_ lamps did n't work .
she insisted that i would get it back if the room was not damaged .
for the most part , everyone has been quite decent .
i had the most amazing experience at spago last week .
i have gone to this place for happy hour for years .
i wo n't be making that mistake again .
i 'm glad i was able to enjoy it once .
all in all , my husband did n't like it too much , either .
god , this place is still as great as ever .
delicious salmon and shrimp quesadilla .
your clothes smell like it after _num_ mins in the hotel .
ok , no big deal , just exchange it .
great atmosphere , food , and drinks -- the sangria is awesome .
octane is their most popular drink and for good reason : it 's strong .
i know some people relish it , i do n't .
the best meal and service in a long time .
avoid at all costs no matter the price .
the food makes it really cool .
all three items were outstanding !
she said she would have a manager call me .
we stayed for _num_ days .
our room in the mardi gras tower was sub par at best .
one of the best tapas restaurants i 've ever been to .
hit up firefly is you want something different that wont cost you mega bucks .
it is extremely outdated .
it was very bland and lacked flavor .
maybe old but fun for the kids .
firefly is the most authentic i have had in the states !
best value in vegas .
the one that hands you the food has an attitude problem .
it was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of fresh mozzarella cheese .
i think the owners are going for quantity not quality .
little clever plays on the traditional to make something unique .
after today , i 'll never go here again .
the pool closed at _num_ pm ( the water slide at 6pm ) .
the ribs was extremely dry .
buffet style breakfast is decent , no bacon though .
their selection was n't very expansive or special .
finally about _num_ i go wait in line again.
the food is mediocre at best .
man that stuff is the best .
it 's 11pm , myself and _num_ other guys walk in .
it was n't worth it !
i did find some batteries here as my camera ran out of power .
but thankfully , the meatloaf was delicious , my pizza was great .
she also can does an excellent job waxing my eye browns .
not a pleasant way to shop at victoria 's secret .
it 's a good place to stay in vegas if you have kids .
you will waste your money and come out sick or hungry or both .
all in all , one of the reasons i stopped going to subway .
spago is a great place with good menu items .
they were trying to charge me for the dinner price !
good price and customers service , i love this place !
the hotel itself is like a maze which i did n't enjoy .
secondly this place sucks .
there was hardly any walking space between and around the _num_ queen beds .
why do they have to charge an arm and a leg for clothes ?
the three associates were all standing by the cash register .
quite an array of choices i might add .
infused water available at _num_ different locations , comfy towels .
the valet sucked and was full every night we were there .
this place is the worst hotel in vegas .
they were delicious too .
airport shuttle is $ _num_ per person - cash only .
in case i did n't say it .
the entire menu is outstanding and very affordable .
all of my friends and i really enjoyed ourselves .
i 've been several times and keep forgetting to give them a write up !
there are a couple decent places to drink and eat in here as well .
dana was our server and she was just terrible !
i 'd be more understanding if the place was busy but it was not .
wo n't ever be spending another penny inside this place again .
i really enjoyed going to fat tuesday .
yuck , after my first experience here i will never come back .
receiving our soup within _num_ minutes and then our main course in _num_ hour !
after dining there , i can see why .
very delicious and conveniently located close to shops and casino floor .
i recommend you do this while in vegas !
great wine selection also .
having to go down to get the other ... kind of annoying .
definitely a great place to bring friends when they come into town .
we chose the excalibur because it was cheap .
great food and excellent service !
only reason to stay here is for a cheap night along the strip .
the store is disorganized and nothing makes sense .
last time i ate here , i saw roaches running around .
my burger was ordered medium and came out well done and not hot .
i cant wait to come back here again !
jumping up and down .
great food , excellent prices and a happening ambiance .
ca n't say enough good about firefly - i was very impressed .
the room was $ _num_ and right on the strip .
one of the best experiences in las vegas that ive been to .
everyone in our party raved about the authenticity of their meal .
it took them _num_ minutes of research to get nothing .
the rooms are very outdated early _num_ 's maybe ?
day two was great .
however , the furnishings are tired and worn .
fun , easy , and great for everyone !
let 's be honest ... no one was expecting _num_ stars here .
we also had a the dessert sampler and everything on it was great .
now i totally understand the ash tray smell in vegas .
the first room we had was horrible .
it comes hand made , fresh and delicious !
worst setup i 've seen in a hotel room .
i will definitely be coming back .
lunch is amazing and dinner is really good as well .
super friendly and well educated .
we enjoyed a caesar salad and the sausage and red pepper pizza .
spend your dollars elsewhere .
the pork barbacoa is incredible .
we got prosciutto and arugula - super good .
my husband and i stayed here over the forth of july weekend .
our waitress was super nice and we loved having a seat by the canal .
it was a disaster from the beginning .
the atmosphere was fantastic .
stuck in time perfectly .
so i have a new favorite !
it 's not the employees fault though , they are all pretty decent .
cons : price for dishes are a little on the high side .
my soup was good however umm there was no lobster in it .
i do n't like being forced to pay for things i will not use .
happy hour would be good here .
the flan was so good , we ordered another .
they actually have a toy store !
the pool area was just concrete & water , not much fun .
some staff members were friendly , others not so much .
key tip is book the west tower .
this mall leaves a lot to be desired .
it has such great breakfast the bagels seem homemade and everything was incredible .
the ride itself on the help was over one hour , which was amazing .
i 'm so pleased with them and i ca n't wait to go back .
but it 's not .
so if you 've had enough to drink you probably wo n't mind it .
great staff very fun experience .
i 'm so sad she 's not here . ''
the hotel is old and stinks .
service was slow , do n't go there if you 're on lunch break .
wow , super good !
the meat was dry .
food , bar , service and experience were all outstanding .
food , bar , service and experience were all outstanding .
sad how this hotel is going downhill fast .
a one of a kind experience for my wife and i .
had lunch here with family and had a great time .
this hotel gave me the most frustrating experience i 've ever had in vegas .
great new york style bagels lox and all the trimmings .
i regret opening store credit here .
( it is n't their place to move my seat setting . )
( it is n't their place to move my seat setting . )
the only reason why i went here was someone else was paying for it .
this was the worst casino we visited while in vegas .
the staff also said happy birthday .
the room was clean but had the smell of a motel .
the house chopped salad with quinoa is so freshly made with garden fresh veggies .
let me tell you `` just rip-off '' .
as well has terrible customer service .
incredibly soft and fit great .
tram to and from excalibur , luxor , and mandalay bay .
prices are great too .
oh my goodness , do i ever love this place .
great atmosphere with lovely food .
i love this store .
this has been the worst stay of any hotel we 've stayed at .
went to vegas and found this gem !
my toes are still not dry .
they will check your bags for you for $ _num_ per bag .
outdoor seating with this weather is perfect .
lots of space and a fancy jacuzzi tub included .
this place is big and decorated beautifully .
i would choose the flamingo rather than harrahs .
vegas is n't exactly lacking expensive high quality restaurants .
i have to say that i really enjoyed my visit to this beautiful store .
please stay this fantastic .
mother of god this establishment is king of spam .
we enjoyed one of the best italian dinners ever here .
sangria pitchers make for a great meal .
service for good for the big group i was with .
she is absolutely amazing , she made it as less painless as possible .
i am extremely dissatisfied with my experience and i want a full refund immediately .
nice bathrooms as well .
love the decor and the ambiance .
more then to deal with all this crap !
they only fixed what the eye could see .
they looked like off duty renaissance fair workers .
i love the layout of the store and always have a positive experience .
she is unhelpful rude and a bitch .
thank god we did !
and the pizzas here are as great as ever .
you 're better off paying a little more for a better buffet .
you can spend hours exploring !
i 'm thinking he just decided to blow me off .
we truly enjoyed this restaurant and i hope you do too .
the only ok thing was the garlic bread out of the whole meal !
customer service is great !
we got great food , great drinks at great prices .
a little too greasy for me .
my drinks are always the right temperature and the proper recipe !
ordered a side of hash browns and got some work done on the computer .
a friend who lives here in vegas took me to this hidden gem .
great place and great food !
the sangria was also really good .
that is not easy here .
it probably took _num_ minutes to get to the desk .
came here with my girlfriend and enjoyed every minute of it .
will for sure return when i 'm back in town for business !
recommend it for all kids .
i will continue coming back here .
my water glass always was full .
by far the most inspired and worthwhile meal i had while in las vegas .
a fun time to be had by all .
the bbq sauce and cheese was the only good stuff on it .
the service and overall experience was fantastic .
duck was wonderful and cooked to perfection .
i received a room with _num_ double beds in a non smoking room .
for the price here its not worth it .
filet sliders were great .
it was hot , perfectly toasted and yummy .
some of our pillows were lumpy .
there is no oil leak , all the oil is still there .
first , i made a reservation on a third party website for _num_ rooms .
it got to me .
i ate here before but will never eat here again .
and the staff are very friendly .
they change their menu seasonally which is refreshing to try new menu options .
generally the hotel is n't too bad .
messed up my nails horribly & would n't refund my money .
i really enjoyed their salad of romaine with roasted salmon and unagi sauce .
the staff is beyond surly and rude .
this is truely a fantastic place .
ok hotel if you like empty promises .
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside .
the good is really good .
price wise , not bad well worth it .
we 'll be back for happy hour next time !
the beef tacos were very good .
i do n't understand how four different servers all made this same basic mistake .
when we got to new rooms they were still disappointing .
the pool on the roof was expected to be a regular pool .
great food and atmosphere as usual .
she said this was what was missing .
i am so happy we found this company !
makes excellent salads , salmon and pizza .
cheese dip is a great appetizer .
no counter space at all to set and alcohol or food or anything on .
french fries were good as well as their red sangria !
best adventure of the trip !
some of the best tapas i 've ever eaten .
_num_ out of the _num_ was good but nothing great .
the range is absolutely great and so where the people .
the prices are excellent .
the guy at the front desk said i could check in at that point .
once they were dropped off , he came back to take our food order .
we rate the place less than a star !
once again it was pretty fun .
we ordered _num_ burgers : _num_ cali 's and _num_ veg .
the supposedly fresh oyster is not so fresh .
my wife and daughter truly enjoyed as well !
place is run down .
we love this restaurant .
we love this restaurant .
food , service , style , elegance , class .
that was very nice .
beautiful clean room once again !
the steak itself was done in most parts - very pink in other parts .
very helpful and attentive staff as a bonus .
the service was just all around terrible .
i have not been here since and do not plan on going back .
stayed in five hotels on out trip all around this price range .
instructors make sure you are comfortable and have a good time .
this place is pretty old , worn and nasty .
this room was _num_ % better !
the restaurant are all cheap food , i would never recommend eating there .
all-in-all , vegas was great , harrah 's was not .
it was a good experience .
the best bagels we 've ever had .
so good , there is no better food .
that day it was n't so bad .
she was absolutely amazing and so much fun to work with .
for us , this was the best food we had in vegas .
i feel sorry for people who have wasted their money on this place .
please do n't order their ahi tuna skewers !
the food at the bar area was very good and the pricing very fair .
oh & the resort fee is a rip off .
our service was prompt and unobtrusive .
i came here with four friends on a monday night .
so it 's like modern vs throwback .
i love pep boys normally , and i would use others .
he was so rude .
i do n't know how this place is _num_ 1/2 stars .
lovely setting as well .
the drink is n't strong , but it tastes really good .
at this point my daughter was extremely upset and crying .
it was abysmal in every possible way .
she really cares about all of the children and makes you feel comfortable .
our room was basic , which was to be expected .
a large group of us decided to go out here tonight .
nowhere on my receipts did it mention the $ _num_ .
telephone service which i did n't even use ?
the crab cakes were the best i ever had .
i really like this place .
not really a great place for kids not just the hotel but vegas period .
this is an every friday morning treat for us .
$ _num_ down the drain .
just make sure you do not get rooms with connecting doors .
all in all , a pretty horrible experience .
no one else was using the self service however .
otherwise , great happy hour find !
i paid for one of the remodeled rooms and it was a horrible experience .
you do n't see that very often .
this was not the case here .
no i paid for it this time .
food was good though .
i would never go back again .
i would never go back again .
love the place and we will be back !
the food is absolutely delicious and very reasonably priced .
they serve lots of beers and mixed drinks and have outdoor seating .
we loved this place !
and both my husband and i liked the food a lot .
please order the mojitos when you go there .
i will bet staying elsewhere next time .
boyfriend was in love with the angus steak , cooked to perfection .
the calamari was also very well prepared .
it 's a waste of time and money .
she never gave me anything to replace it with either .
taco sampler is awesome .
the food was so greasy it was gross .
i always get the tall cup one .
always packed but for good reason .
their bathrooms are really nice too .
all the pieces of the rolls were literally falling apart .
furniture was falling apart .
upon arrival to my room the bathroom did n't have any bath towels .
some items were a huge hit , and some things were just good .
( waiting since 11pm ) .
my bf is n't even a salad person but he loved it .
but i stayed calm and walked away .
the ambience is great despite the somewhat tacky props and decor .
so very unhappy with what i am experiencing at this hotel at this moment .
i had my wedding reception here and it was an amazing experience !
best dining experience in vegas yet !
currently sitting here for _num_ minutes waiting for my appointment .
there gluten free menu was very extensive and delicious !
it was n't as good as i expected .
coach is very expensive '' .
_num_ ) nasty pool .
the prices were great it 's a must try !
they said ok , you just need to come down to the lobby .
the elevators are super slow .
beyond that ... it was a total dive .
i know places have bugs that us customers never see .
they had good promotions going on .
kinda cool in a vanilla sky kind of way .
the last 1/2 star is for the deep fried oreo .
another review from someone that has n't been impressed .
but , if you 're a girl in vegas you will have fun .
their sangria 's are delicious !
they helped me understand everything about the gun before i bought it .
love this place ... .
he said it would cost too much to set a table just for dessert .
i 've never tried fatburger in my life .
the villa is dated .
the poker room card shuffle machines hardly work .
everything in this place is good .
i will not return to this dennys .
i enjoyed it and would probably do it again when i return to vegas .
first and foremost our room was clean .
also , the cilantro rice is amazing .
he would n't even take it if it was in a plastic bag .
all of their food is fantastic and you 'll enjoy a fine dining experience .
after they investigate , they told me door was not locked ( what ?
probably wo n't come back here again for a stay .
you will love the customer service and unlimited food and drinks .
will definitely be coming back here !
there is no in door seating just the outdoor patio so dress accordingly .
overall a bad experience .
sweet n spicy shrimp tasted chinese .
the ahi tuna salad was very blend .
the room was just a basic king room , but the tv channels sucked .
gourmet quality tapas , great for sharing !
plus his uni did n't look buttery fresh .
there is really nothing for them .
the decor is really pretty and romantic .
it has pretty good number of slot machines .
the staff is so friendly and helpful here .
the food choices are great and the quality excellent .
i checked & sure enough there still wet and smell horrible .
the lines are n't clean and the ink is n't consistent .
the venetian boat ride is kinda expensive , but it 's pretty cool .
i 'm not really sure what the theme of this hotel is .
the thai beef salad is also really good !
but to make matters worse , parking was horrible .
the tv had less channels than the free cable i get at home .
this was by far the worst dining experience i 've ever had .
it is nowhere worth $ _num_ .
i got the jalapeno bagel with butter , and it was super delicious !
she said she would credit my card back for the missing items .
if she has it not she will order it and that makes me happy .
the initial experience at the lobby left a foul stench .
* happy hour is limited strictly to the bar area .
i could go on but really , i loved everything .
stuffed dates , yeah !
way too many options to tolerate this treatment .
really loved this place !
each dish was delightful , although the warm spinach salad was my least favorite .
i ordered the special which was short rib sandwich ... amazing .
everything i have ever eaten here has been delicious .
the hotel was easy to locate and parking was not much of a hassle .
a must come to place to eat !
all i was offered by the hotel staff was _num_ small ice packs .
this place is bare bones , and your bones friggin ' stink !
it 's even better now .
few items under $ _num_ in the red wine category .
this is a shame for an established food chain !
but , the food was delicious !
long walk from the elevator to the room .
the beds are old and very uncomfortable .
lastly , the best part about this restaurant is the location .
sangria was super refreshing .
while we were a bit disappointed we understood .
the faux sky that looks like an actual night sky is downright amazing .
the menu is so varied that it is perfect for any palate .
i hear this is becoming common in lv but i find it ridiculous .
most especially their chocolate cake and original glazed ones .
the refrigerator was not working & had mold all in it .
the casino was also a huge hit .
poor selection and cheap quality products .
i personally would not stay here again .
oh ... the `` free internet '' was awful !
everyone else who i take there loves it as well .
it 's easy to access & can be found without difficulty .
i stayed here with my boyfriend for our _num_ year anniversary .
so tender , so good .
this is my go to spot for happy hour !
do n't do it word of advise .
waste of money and will never stay their again .
yummy tapas for sure !
man , everything was awesome !
there is no restaurant .
he kinda listens , but is really looking at my tickets .
love the food , great location - perfect spot for lunch .
best casino on the strip by far .
this location is the nicest one in las vegas !
you just gave us access to someone 's room .
this is a true new york style deli .
see ya for new years !
the dining room is just awful .
our waiter brandon was funny and helpful with suggestions .
the drinks were amazing and we all got different flavors to share and sample .
excessive charge on the internet , uncomfortable and torn beds .
i wish i could post pictures to this site .
the uniforms , brand in general is just terrible .
the store was n't bright enough .
when i walked in , a weird smell came from the bathroom .
only stay if everything else is booked .
prices are great too !
my group thoroughly enjoyed all our dishes , especially the bacon wrapped dates !
this is a very well maintained hotel .
it 's cheap if thats what you are looking for .
i am so glad to be making my last payment to this location .
something like $ _num_ , so u think .
i also like the sparkling sangria ( the pitcher is a great deal ) .
huge breakfast portion sizes .
i took the monorail multiple times this week and had a great experience .
bad : property management system and staff not knowing how to use it .
very helpful when attending a convention .
the bartender will not take your food order .
i mean the philly cheese steak at subway tasted better then this .
everything else was just ok .
wonderful restaurant get here before 10pm if you 're hungry .
this place is huge & the layout is awesome .
if you want to black out , feel free to request extra shots .
it was n't what i 'm used to .
i was very disappointed tonight .
it looked pretty outdated and is mostly slots .
great meal off the strip .
do n't expect anything from a room upgrade in the ice skating rink .
well , the pastrami sandwich was as dry as the vegas air .
totally good hotel hotel .
best key lime pie ever !
my friends liked their food too .
the only great thing about harrahs is the location which is central to everything .
best meal in vegas along with excellent service .
seriously , do not stay here .
the souffl was n't rich enough for me .
the menu had plenty of choices and the food was excellent !
does n't come on up into your space and leave a mess .
my husband had lasagna which he said was wonderful .
best show in vegas !
even their slot machines was fairly nice to me and my so .
to be fair , the latter is n't excalibur 's fault .
this place hit home .
firefly is one of the best restaurants i have eaten at in las vegas !
anyway , the slots downstairs in the casinos were actually pretty cool .
do n't let it happen to you .
i definitely enjoy the monorail to zip around town .
got some free drinks , i was stoked .
this place is perfect for a big group like ours was .
the firefly fries and calamari are awesome !
the slots are fair , and the staff is incredible .
the service was fast and friendly .
what i really like about this place is they are truly kid friendly .
the only thing that was ok was my california roll .
do n't worry this establishment will be hearing from my attorney .
this place is horrible .
this place is horrible .
this place is horrible .
everyday i need a new room key they never work .
dog urine stains on sofa corners shower curtain full of mold .
that 's not my problem !
our server was extremely nice and took good care of us .
i love the location .
this is not a way to save money for the company ... .
great service from a knowledgeable staff is the norm at discount firearms .
harrah 's is great !
the food was delicious , service was great !
which this location does not know anything about .
man , what a very rude old lady .
ron does a great job .
my family and i love this hotel because it is very kid friendly .
do not stay here .
do not stay here .
do not stay here .
do not stay here .
i almost did n't because she was rude and slow .
the location is great but the check-in process is the worst .
really , come on .
`` we finance anyone '' is a bunch of crap .
looking forward to come back and i will bring more people !
other than that , great !
he was extremely knowledgeable , helpful , and pleasant .
valet has also been pretty quick and more importantly available .
waited _num_ minutes to be seated .
perfect for _num_ degree weather !
this is a very good shopping complex to walk through .
firefly has excellent food when you know what order .
i will definitely go back .
maybe if i was really drunk this would be good .
the food is very good and the atmosphere is cool .
had spicy jerk shrimp and almond crusted mahi .
it 's why i 'm giving them _num_ stars .
not as good as i was hoping for .
i would not recommend this doctor nor her office for medical care .
the first time was january _num_ .
the cheesesteak was a sloppy mess .
would n't pay full price for this at all .
it was definitely not clean .
there are so many better options close by for ayce sushi .
yes , bad timing perhaps .
the reason i 'm giving _num_ stars is because the food was soooo good .
the service is always great , and the food even better .
i wish i could give them _num_ star for this rating .
the midway is great and the free circus acts are fab .
when we got it we were disappointed .
he is fair , honest , and compassionate in his business .
how many customers like us have been treated this way .
she was patient and helped put together a great set for my girlfriend .
instructor was very helpful and very patient with us .
the service was over the top !
thank you for taking the time to contact ross stores .
the food is really good .
this place is an absolute dump !
the mini suite was very spacious and i really liked the layout .
even if they offer me a comped room , i will never go back .
i was a customer willing to drop some money .
it was perfectly dressed with just the right amount of dressing .
worst run store i 've been in .
best tapas hands down !
she will do your makeup beautifully and is extremely versatile .
and yum to that hurricane one !
will definitely come back !
they are very efficient and helpful .
i waited _num_ 1/2 hours for her to be be rude to me !
if i 'd known the real price , i would have stayed somewhere else .
the staff , service , and expertise will leave you smiling wide and bright .
we paid $ _num_ and $ _num_ was comped back to us .
what a creepy little shit hole .
i could n't believe it .
i could n't believe it .
he will be my doctor that i always go to now .
our 1st wedding anniversary dinner was celebrated at circo .
the staff is rude and knows nothing about customer service .
she let her try some flavors and was super sweet and upbeat .
a table of _num_ , entrees all around , two bottles of wine .
and it 's firefly so still super yummy .
the location of the hotel is bad too .
kids still had fun though .
jacuzzi did n't work right .
foods great happy hour even better !
im completely disgusted with this place and wont ever be going back .
very reasonably price thing to do on the strip !
i was told the wash should take about _num_ minutes .
they also changed all of the linens which did n't help .
i mean these drinks are top shelf !
it smelled like weed the whole time !
bad service and would not recommend this salon to anyone .
good server , very nice ambiance , delicious margaritas !
i called front desk immediately and explained everything , but nothing could be done .
i will definitely eat at firefly next time i am in vegas !
i as pleasantly surprised !
the choices there overpriced and disgusting .
the owner and her team created beautiful bouquets and flower pieces for our wedding .
no offer to help me find it .
it 's overpriced & not really authentic to begin with .
excellent place to catch the stars and take a picture !
i feel like there is no way possible to win .
i love mac pro stores !
i highly recommend this place for anyone .
atmosphere was trying but lacking !
-- -- _num_ stars !
even the lamp was hard to turn on .
no broccoli , just a baked potato .
natalie 's staff is amazing .
oysters were not very fresh .
we paid $ _num_ for _num_ sandwiches and we were not impressed at all .
i was able to relax and trust that i was in good hands .
it made me very happy .
poor quality of work , poor customer service .
we get to the room and everything was just so tacky and old .
e got the never ending shrimp .
i have never stayed in any hotel / motel without a coffee maker !
this place sucks and the rooms stink .
i talked to two different managers and nothing was ever done .
the sales rep was really sweet and helpful .
stay here for the cheap room , but not much else .
fat tuesday definitely gives you your money 's worth .
some good restaurants and the employees are courteous .
i mean , really ?
based upon our experience , excalibur is hardly of high caliber .
good vibe and buzz .
if you are in vegas this place is a must .
good pricing as well .
from start to finish it was truly an awful experience .
: ( overall great place .
we enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and the spacious _num_ bedroom suite .
save yourself the trouble and avoid this experience .
the service was great , i 'd go back just for the people watching !
other than that is just not worth the money and sometimes the wait .
this place is mediocre at it 's very best .
this could be a great lunch item by itself .
the rest was stuck in the 90s .
i am not sure why they sent so much but there was no conditioner !
food there is good , service was good as well .
very nice , very clean .
clearly the room was not cleaned thoroughly , tv did not work .
the trainer john was excellent and there with us the who time .
but las vegas water district did nothing !
super friendly and fast service .
literally we were in hell !
i ordered a hamburger with lettuce , tomato , pickles , and onions .
such a great hand out place off the strip .
nothing mind blowing ... .
great service & attentive workers !
drink and $ _num_ a beer .
then would not honor the coupon i had .
overall a good experience .
this hotel is now probably the worst on the strip next to sahara .
bahama breeze is a fun place to eat !
this server was the worst .
i got the house margarita and it was fantastic !
i think i stayed here _num_ years ago and everything looks just the same .
but do not assume that a guest is smoking drugs when they are n't .
i 'm not a big museum person but was worth the price of admission .
but , i do n't care about furniture that much .
the atmosphere is great , and the price is n't too steep .
it 's just the best .
other than that , the food was meh .
he only ate half of it because of that reason .
very disappointing for a las vegas hotel .
the office staff is rude and lazy .
but as my experience for the food , it was not good at all .
price : you 're paying a lot for a bunch of sugar .
i left and did business with another place .
this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed in !
shame on you , pep boys .
had the filet - it was perfect and a delicious caesar salad .
second , $ _num_ per day for internet ?
you also do n't benefit from generous bartenders like you would at evening call .
it 's been a good _num_ years since i last came .
the last two dining experiences i have had there have been awful .
spago has a great lunch/dinner menu , and has a kids menu as well .
a place you can always count on to deliver .
in a jungle full of competitive hotel service , harrahs lost my business .
the hand crafted cocktails were all amazing and a great start to the meal .
would definitely recommend it .
would definitely recommend it .
we had a nice dinner out here and were really happy with everything .
we go to vegas almost each summer and we are booked elsewhere this year .
i am going to go after the door lock manufacturer and excalibur .
fyi i have always called in to book my reservation .
lacked flavor and was just plain bad , especially for $ _num_ .
and the chile relleno looked good enough to marry .
caused my children to be upset and almost ruined our vegas family vacation .
best chinese food i 've ever had .
on a nice night , ask to be seated outside .
the food is always awesome and i always start with the cuban bread .
the wax statues are very realistic they do a terrific job .
the tres leches chocolate cake is phenomenal !
i gave it one star because i could not give it a zero .
i also went to use the iron .
come here every time i visit las vegas !
amazing pizza , pasta and salads !
i mean , you get what you pay for , i know .
the service was great too .
i do not recommend this hotel to anyone .
service was great ; prompt & friendly .
definitely check this place out !
well the inside if my car was not clean .
but , i doubt i will go there again .
the furniture in the room was old and worn down .
i also got to sample the watermelon sorbet .
did not even feel comfortable taking my shoes off in the room .
i could n't believe i waited _num_ minutes just to hear that .
stayed here at a groupon rate .
if at all possible , stay away from here .
however that lasted only so long , we were tired .
ribs was not part of it .
it was a wednesday night that we stayed .
chips and salsa was also really good !
but they wo n't do it .
first , the place is butt ugly .
this experience has been terrible .
food was fabulous and the sangria was the best i 've ever had !
they were the best we 've ever had .
there is a large variety of food choices to please everyone .
i had the mango slush with the extra shot .
other than that the staff was very friendly and we enjoyed ourselves !
had a delicious lunch at wolfgang puck 's spago and would definitely come back !
for $ _num_ more i could have stayed at a four star hotel .
i will never visit this place again .
so we stopped on every floor from the 21st , on .
never again will i think of staying here again .
i 'm going to set up the story so that it 's clear .
the third night the water was freezing cold and never got hot .
worst vegas trip of my life !
the food was epic !
spago at the forum shops is one of my favorite lunch destinations .
this mcdonald 's was one of the worst i 've ever been to .
i can honesty say this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed in .
our room was dusty .
better than most shopping places in casinos on the strip .
in total $ _num_ was spent for two nights there .
great place for a sandwich .
our instructor was soo amazing .
also , i was somewhat annoyed that they charged an early check in fee .
nothing super stellar though , either .
wife had prime rib quesadilla that was great !
they did a great job and i was satisfied with my overall experience .
the rooms were nice and comfy but the casino kicks ass .
thank you fellow yelpers , you did good !
live music was very good also .
they went above and beyond to make sure my day went smoothly .
the beer and sausage sliders were yummy though !
maurice was so great to work with and the food was amazing !
the only good part of this location as opposed to the london location ?
went there thinking this place would be good .
it has gone downhill over the past few years .
ok , do casinos attract the greatest of folks ?
see ya next time love !
i will bring friends and family to this location .
i am a vegas veteran been there four times this year alone .
there was me , and maybe _num_ other people at this bar .
its also hard to navigate through .
the gambling options are limited and the slots are outdated .
lots of specials running for the night ... all around a great place .
which is n't saying much .
i absolutely love this place .
to be honest , i would just stay away .
not a professional or talented place .
my friend had the wild mushrooms enchiladas .
the rooms were mediocre ; reminded me of a motel rather than a hotel .
yellow tail tasted like soap , uni was not the right color .
coffee was served with real cream and a great selection of deserts .
our family is so grateful for my daughters outstanding care .
that was the best part of dinner .
there is also convenient tram service to and from luxor and mandalay bay .
she is the one to see for beautiful gel nails that last for months .
we paid _num_ the shit .
the decor and feel of the place is like a true modern cantina .
there were _num_ of us so we got _num_ rooms with _num_ beds .
food - negative one star
no one here should be allowed to tattoo .
i highly recommend this menu .
i really think she had no clue on what she was doing .
all in all , it 's a solid _num_ stars .
one word : disappointment .
i love their jello shots too !
what really put me off about this place is the service .
chef , food , service and management the best .
the crust was as delicious as the main dish .
i normally stay elsewhere .
their happy hour is the best !
do n't give this place your money !
the restaurant has a lovely circus setting , and great servers .
but its still good , and worth the trip down there .
after this visit we are loyal to spago !
i am beyond frustrated .
people working here ruined the mood .
always a pleasure to eat here .
the bands were beautiful and delivered within budget .
food service is not acceptable .
we had a wonderful meal at spago in the forum shops at caesars palace .
the only great thing was the crime brle , that was good stuff .
the food is excellent .
maybe the best meal i have ever had .
there was nothing special about it .
half the elevators work , half of them do not .
the staff is great and helpful .
oh , he said `` i threw it in the garbage !
buy a drink and pour some extra vodka on the top .
firefly is loud , crowded , and totally fun .
the jerk fire shrimp !
you have got to dance here .
our room was _num_ % clean .
it is a shame but we will never return .
rest of it was a total waste of time .
i had the beef rib and polenta which was rich and delicious .
love there drinks great value for what you get .
took them a really long time to get to the sink .
the tomato soup is fabulous .
i was thinking of getting a shirt made up .
not a great experience and probably will tell everyone not to go here .
i do n't get how this place has so many good reviews !
out dated casino , this visit brought too many additional ridiculous charges .
so happy with my meal .
maybe she can have better luck dealing with the issues .
the service is also good .
the ceviche was so fresh and clean tasting .
service is pretty good .
never in my life have a been so pissed of with someone .
love the food and the service .
the tables are moderately priced as well .
fabulous tapas , great atmosphere , and the sangria is delish .
it 's very expensive but the food was amazing .
love , love , love this place !
they 're red sangria was worth the trip !
same thing happened again and they refused to give me my money back .
unique clothes , wall to wall .
get a pitcher and share it with your friends .
charges for room is misleading .
it is what it is i guess .
the texture of the meat is totally off .
if you are a traveler seeking vegas luxury , i suggest booking elsewhere .
other receptionists call us down over to them .
spend the extra money and book at a cleaner hotel .
i will definitely be back !
i will definitely be back !
i will definitely be back !
i will definitely be back !
i found it informative and at times entertaining .
the house smoked salmon pizza is a very unique dish .
we all left with a satisfying buzz and a full stomach .
this is the real deal , and the sizes are huge .
hit the pool area and let the fun begin .
almost seemed like they were hiding bad fish quality .
can not believe they hire people you ca n't understand over the phone .
then just shrugged me off .
they did not do any of them but offered to shampoo the mats .
prices are reasonable and the staff is always friendly .
the bathrooms are disgusting .
do n't say i did n't warn you .
the food is not so good .
our room smelled like sewer gas from day one .
to hell with that !
i think i might think it twice .
and there 's multiple locations to refill your cup at !
a fantastic sports bar in the heart of vegas !
thanks for making my mini vacation very enjoyable !
really well crafted dinner .
it was disgusting and unacceptable .
my meal was great !
will not be back again .
it was a fun place for the entire group .
staff are nice and seem to get things done .
the chicken wings dry ( lacking glaze ) and over cooked .
the place is busy but the times with good people made it fly by .
so the hotel was not bad .
big , secure valet lot was nice too .
if i could give it negative stars , i would .
great place for family and friends !
but , their happy hour is something worth checking out .
i i 'll recommend to stay away from that office , find another doctor .
the wild mushroom enchilada was perfection .
very disappointing , they were probably very expensive too !
very fresh salad , pasta is high quality , lasagna soo good !
since i 've always wanted to try out excalibur .
we always bring our friends here when they come to visit vegas .
my chicken and the little side thing ( veggies ? )
new menu , new chef and was most impressed .
save your money and get one of the other rooms instead .
beats taking the taxi .
the coconut shrimp are legendary .
it 's just a good place serving good food .
definitely coming back here when we 're in vegas again .
the room itself is n't horrible .
the ac smelled really gross at certain times when it was running .
one thing you should know is that the _num_ buildings actually connect .
the service has always been great .
we got a great room in the casino hotel .
sales people here are fabulous !
$ _num_ dollars i wish had back .
however service was less than mediocre .
she is a whiz with the makeup and has great tips .
of course , hours go by and we 've just completely missed the boat .
everything is flavorful and well executed .
great stop for breakfast !
the owner nor the manager would not admit their mistake .
now have fun walking to the pool buzzed and ready to talk to strangers .
it was all very good and reasonably priced .
needless to say , we left without buying .
customer service training is in order .
the caesar was excellent , the mozzarella a nice light tasting salad .
i loved everything i ordered especially the mushroom thing !
* there are no good restaurants in this hotel .
the server and bartenders are fun as well .
however , this is not the first time i became ill after eating here .
i love love love this place .
our slices were n't all that great either .
our server was great & took excellent care of us .
for _num_ bucks it is totally worth it .
okay well he tells me it was really flavorless .
any of the fat tuesday locations are great to visit .
mini fridge did not work .
i 'm thinking ... did n't we have this conversation an hour ago ?
there is a great wine selection too .
the linens really sucked .
i booked the room for pool view side .
that 's a quick turnaround , nice !
it was actually my first time having oysters and i thought they were delicious .
so kind and a complete gentleman .
, and its so easy to use !
the buffet was ok ; i had better ones off the strip .
really ... ... _num_ stars ?
service is decent , not great .
this is the best apple store .
best deal on drinks you will find in las vegas .
they are rude and blame things on everybody but themselves .
great food , friendly atmosphere and the bartender bruce was super .
steve was our instructor .
so tacky and rude !
think nostalgia went more into the triple d pick than the food .
great food and a great happy hour menu !
as another reviewer said , this place is dirty .
the a/c 's auto function didnt work .
the first night , the room was clean .
the drinks are great .
firefly in las vegas is a nice place .
just paperwork for an oil change took _num_ minutes .
we found firefly on yelp , and really thought it deserved its great rating !
a little pricey but the food was amazing !
finally we find parking .
now you know , so go stand in line .
tip - mix the hurricane and the _num_ for a tasty treat !
the guacamole was very fresh with cilantro and red onion .
these people are rude and no professional .
very disappointed with their lack of customer service .
the roasted salsa is very good and we 've always had good meals here .
the selection here is out of this world and the service is impeccable !
these lil things r strong !
not even for large groups !
otherwise a great place .
the tram runs directly from here to mandalay bay , the conference casino .
overall , a great value for the price .
it 's fast enough and gets you where you need to go .
there are too many other hotels to choose from .
overall the rooms that we got were very clean .
the food was all very good and comes out quickly .
they clearly do not clean these rooms thoroughly .
i loved this hotel / casino .
harrahs room was old , stinky and in horrible condition .
it will be a constant frustration .
the exam rooms are cozy and feature wall art from his clients .
i tipped & i still ended up feeling like i 'm the bad guy .
the mussels in coconut sauce was a pleasant surprise .
from running to basketball , they got it .
absolutely love this place .
absolutely love this place .
there is no sun on the pool at all .
the service is always good and i frequently take colleagues here .
this is my 3rd visit .
honestly , there has to be better italian food or vegas is in trouble .
they have the best gnocchi i 've ever had !
lady was hard to understand , even for me !
we had lunch there and the waiters gave impeccable service .
the sangria was crisp , fruity and tasty .
the environment was amazing .
she offered to upgrade our room to a pool view for an extra fee .
other dishes we tried were very good .
the food itself was very good !
now my husband can be as stylish as me !
we both had the huevos rancheros and it was different but really good .
overall not a good time .
, but harrah 's has nothing to set it apart .
on top of that they charge hotel resort fee .
this was the perfect snack while walking around miracle mile in planet hollywood .
the hotel was clean and pretty easy to navigate .
great place to stay and its in the perfect location !
one of my favorite spots in vegas .
we will no come back .
the catered event had lots of fun foods to try as well as karaoke .
too pricey for the quality .
my room was a standard room , and it was motel sized .
the service was impeccable !
but definitely worth the try .
simply stay away from this hotel .
this is pretty boring .
i like this place and with the right company it is a blast .
bagel fresh , tasty , and full of sesame seeds .
definitely will make this my regular place .
totally unprofessional and uncaring to say the least .
i was nervous at first but dave made sure we were relaxed and comfortable .
they charge when additional rice is ordered .
the biggest standout was def the dates !
chips and salsa were delicious .
came back again with my girlfriend and it is as good as ever .
the food was the best part , my favorite being the stuffed dates .
and probably not even doing their job .
everything in vegas is always amazing .
the couch did n't even belong in the goodwill .
this was n't my first time .
cream corn was very good too .
firefly has all three plus great tapas .
to this day , i still have not received my refund back .
at least we got them , i guess ?
this place really sucks .
i was so excited to get some pop 's tonight !
come down to check it out !
this is a nice way to cool off in the vegas heat .
first time here and i loved it !
dirty filthy disgusting place with horrible service .
the mint sauce was nice & light & the berries fresh .
most beautiful banana republic that i have ever been in .
the staff is very friendly , upbeat and above all very experienced .
the worst customer service ever .
always delicious , never dissapointed .
( waiter tuxedo restaurant ) .
got ta come back for happy hour !
for those fees , there should be some actual amenities provided .
pay $ _num_ to $ _num_ for a better hotel on the strip ... .
do n't go here they waste ur time !
it does n't make any sense ?
i order roll that 's not to be spicy and it was very spicy .
atmosphere is a _num_ .
i loved my food at spago .
hands down best tapas i 've ever had !
for some reason my manager gave ya 'll a _num_ % discount !
very careful , attentive , and pleasant staff really make a difference .
so much flavor to choose from !
a great bang for your buck !
the philly was stuffed to the rim and there was bacon in every bite .
i dont know what i was thinking expecting it from this restaurant .
even the restaurants within were terrible .
the service was as snooty as i remembered it .
the place has gone to hell since the mgm bought it .
their sangria and mojitos are also some of the best i 've ever had .
the cocktails are creative and delicious .
i had the best time at the beach !
so i 've been scammed twice by the excalibur .
no selection , and unhappy and unhelpful sales people .
in the mardi gras floor the rooms are extremely dated .
do n't let the castle exterior fool you .
i found this very irritating .
the rooms are fine ; very small and the bed is a murphy bed .
the lines are long and the food it awful !
this is hands down the best italian food in the city .
we are all lucky that nothing worse happened to us during our stay .
i love mushrooms and the mushroom tart was great !
after check in we were stopped _num_ times by sales people .
after check in we were stopped _num_ times by sales people .
very friendly wait staff .
first , we ordered the cajun fries and the mac and cheese bites .
seriously - check this place out - you 'll be pleased you did .
i showed pic of $ _num_ coupon and manager said it was okay .
i will leave the points for the decorations to other reviewer .
definitely recommend to anyone .
great place to stop and eat if you 're shopping in the forum shops .
great martini 's , great food and great atmosphere !
our servers were attentive and on top of all our extra requests .
the staff treated me very well and the bed was beyond comfortable .
super close to strip .
the service has been good to great every time i have been there .
this was the best of _num_ hotels we stayed at during our road trip .
custom orders are welcomed and they will ship anything anywhere !
if it 's busy , it 's worth the wait .
they treat you so well here .
i would definitely eat here again .
the rooms were completely gross .
if you are hungry , definitely order the pork barbacoa .
this place is a nice relaxed feel with live music .
they delivered new keys instead .
las vegas first timer !
he really pissed me off .
one of the best breakfasts and values in vegas .
that is n't an option on my mac .
you really get what you pay for here .
this is just dirty .
great off the strip tapas restaurant .
nice place , love the tropical ambiance .
staff is very friendly .
the best way to start off your vegas trip !
day _num_ , we found out the coffee maker was broken .
as far as i 'm concerned you should be very ashamed of your establishment !
the resort charge does n't get you anything either .
the service is good ; but the food is mediocre at best .
it 's awful awful awful .
from the minute we walked into the resort , everything was pretty basic .
positively delicious , every bite was perfection !
they have lost good customers tonight .
it has gone downhill perhaps more than any other mall in the valley .
your best off eating somewhere other than harrahs .
they said they could n't return them .
they were all very kind and helpful .
this place was great for my first -- but probably only -- time .
definitely a vegas favorite !
it tasted a little bland .
my first experience at the excalibur was not good not bad just okay .
so i then said , `` nope , i 'm done thank you '' .
needs a remodel in a bad way .
the chopped salad was delish and it made me feel good about ordering it .
tapas is not normally my thing , but this was quite enjoyable .
this was my first and last time at this restaurant .
had nice sunday lunch .
sushi is fresh and reasonably priced !
the staff are always friendly and knowledgeable .
our waiter was very good !
it had a very smooth almost creamy texture with some really great flavor .
definately will be coming back with my family .
looks like it 's been there awhile .
the room we got was part of the newly renovated section of the hotel .
in addition to this utter nonsense ?
the worst restaurant experience i have ever had .
the thai beef salad was okay .
my husband and i came here to gamble during our stay in las vegas .
our third course was scallops my absolute favorite at every restaurant except here .
explained everything to me well enough for me to understand .
rooms are old as well as old nasty carpet .
we will definitely go back the next time we are in vegas !
not sure if it 's really any better than the smoke itself .
ok - so far i 'm thinking we 're starting off right .
the waitress walked away from our table before we finished ordering .
the bread they offer is delicious as well .
one of the best restaurants in vegas !
love the caribbean theme !
lunch was excellent also .
he informed me that they did n't have any salami .
night crowd is full of eye candy too !
next time , i do n't think there will be one .
or hell , just walk across the street to firefly for actual tasty food !
lots of great tapas and you must try their aged sangria .
the service was awesome and the food was great .
firefly , this is my second visit .
everything on the menu is awesome !
we had a wonderful time at dinner here tonight .
i left a message , no reply .
service was perfect , food was perfect .
this place is cool .
friendly service and my drink was good !
the service is totally fast and friendly .
my boyfriend ordered the salmon avocado roll and that was so good !
i wish i could give it zero stars !
it 's located right across from caesar 's palace and next to the venetian .
we moved into paradise apartments in july .
it gets packed on weekends , so beware !
rooms are ok clean but no wifi , are you kidding ?
where do i begin , this place is fantastic , the decor is beautiful .
he was so friendly and helpful .
great location , right in the heart of the strip .
it 's so annoying .
the strawberry and mango flavor is refreshing .
i found perfect princess cut diamonds as they were in my building .
i checked and i had no oil in my car .
all of the food is good .
: ( very disappointing since this is what they are known for .
top with decadent dessert and irish coffee .
wi-fi would n't stay connected anyway .
the best corned beef hash i 've ever had and the bagels , amazing .
only thing i have to say is i come from south florida .
this was the spot to go before you turn _num_ .
$ _num_ happy hour margaritas .
service was very attentive .
this was definitely not the worst hotel experience i 've ever had .

we left after _num_ minutes .
we had several dishes , which were all so delicious .
the resort fee is a joke .
i love the selection and freshness .
this place is amazing and huge !
they 're full service too , which is cool .
if you get the chance to , seriously hit up this mac store .
totally not worth the price of admission .
i seen our server _num_ time .
selection was horrible also .
the service is outstanding !
i hated the place wasted my time of _num_ hours .
my friend ordered the steak fajitas and i ordered the tres tacos .
i met a friend here during their happy hour .
fat tuesday , you are freaking delicious .
i actually could n't wait to leave vegas because it was so miserable .
very tasty menu top to bottom .
every filipino restaurant in new york gives a free order of rice per person .
and no cough drops .
all i can say is very very disappointed !
we asked for a picture , and he was really nice about it .
i do n't understand all the rave reviews .
ya ya ya i know wtf am i doing staying here .
it 's a blast .
this indoor swap meet really had nothing to offer , at least for me .
i still like this place and it is the best tapas restaurant in town .
it was an awesome time and a unique experience for sure .
service i was adequate .
all delivered from an uncaring staff .
probably not staying here again in the future .
wishing _num_ minutes it disappeared and was turned off .
best regular margarita and best jalapeno margarita i 've ever had , without question .
really pissed , but trying to manage a smile since tomorrow 's christmas .
i usually always find a product that i love .
and even still , do n't buy it from here .
i do n't know how this place received such high rating .
it 's a combination on sweet and savory unlike any other !
i was not about to leave my iphone and wallet with this lady !
ambiance was nice and the people watching was terrific .
it stayed _num_ and above in the room .
i do not recommend the buffet , but that was only me .
i love tapas style places .
the place has a tropical feel and very airy , spacious .
very professional , friendly and knowledgeable .
super fun , just as everyone else described , thanks tony !
the sheet corners were ripped and stained with grease .
first , the mgm lion thing and now this .
great place to try !
i highly recommend it .
i highly recommend it .
i highly recommend it .
i had a complaint and he started to get rude and condescending .
i 'm not sure i 'll be back .
i do not recommend this room .
service was great and very helpful to assist us on first time visiting .
my son has been going here since he was _num_ months old .
will definitely make it back there again .
the salmon one was pretty flat , no taste .
they are all so different and interesting to peruse through .
i would never stay here again .
but really , a balance needs to be struck .
had an amazing experience one of the best ways to start your birthday weekend !
i too would have given this hotel a big fat zero !
i 'm giving them four stars because it tasted good and was reasonably priced .
i 'd give it a zero , but i 'm trying to be nice .
and honestly the best black and white cookie of my life .
_num_ octane and the other red one was really freaking strong !
once we went outside or to another hotel , we were fine .
i 'm enjoying my chocolate mint ice cream to end my dinner .
the drinks were good and the food was well prepared .
the meal was terrific .
the girl that was helping us was unprofessional and rude .
because to me , $ _num_ is a lot of money for nothing .
servers were awesome , food was great , music was great and fitting .
the room was as excellent _num_ stars !
nothing but love for this place and it 's staff .
the restaurants are , at best , also mediocre and very expensive .
not to our room .
to my surprise , he came back with a bill for $ _num_ .
luckily place was too expensive to stay .
this is the second worst casino i have ever visited in my entire life .
i 'll definitely be back .
i now understand why they have only _num_ stars out of _num_ reviews .
the bed was very comfy and the flat screen tv was cool .
did n't give us confirmation of this ur reservation .
my husband 's duck was terrible , he could not eat that either .
they never fail me !
nothing like spending your new years eve in a room infested with bed bugs !
awesome service , good food , definitely coming back here again with friends !
my previous day room charge was cheaper than my late check out .
in this case , perhaps a bit less .
perfect princess cut is beyond phenomenal !
not worth the price for what you get .
this is just terrible and unacceptable .
very friendly and plenty of parking .
the dealers at the roulette tables are always friendly and outgoing , especially mike .
it 's broken , if not enough to have not taken your money .
gambling is about # _num_ on the list of vegas money makers .
it 'll give you a headache .
got my makeup done for a wedding .
just like this one !
not only is this business absolutely affordable , it 's so clean !
thank you for the work you do here , god bless you all .
this was a really fun place .
great fun with darn good food .
it had the right amount of everything and looked and tasted fresh .
going to keep this short and sweet !
food was very very good - especially the crab cakes and the drinks !
wow the chef menu was yummy the chef is even better .
i love their mojitos !
our room seems to be assigned to someone else .
$ _num_ dollar , hour and a half long delivery time pizza .
i am a huge osso bucco fan and this was below average .
the food alone is maybe a _num_ star .
the only thing that struck me as odd was his offering of cuban cigars .
the kitchen was so messy and floor was disgusting .
we went to the wynn buffet one day and it was awesome .
it 's usually busy , i love the music , setting and mood .
the rooms are small and the check-in staff is barely accomodating .
the kitchen staff clearly does n't give a fuck .
i have been in better , i have been in worse .
i 'm a fan .
the breakfast burrito was good , coffee was good and the view is amazing !
my room was very substandard .
i 'm trying to relax .
beautiful patio , reasonable prices and excellent food .
its dirt cheap and its easy to see why once you 're inside .
the person who helped my partner was attentive and very kind .
the staff is super fun .
$ _num_ for _num_ nights and _num_ show tickets .
fast , convenient and accurate service ... isnt that what its all about ?
great place to cool off during the vegas hot weather .
then i show up , and my reservation has been cancelled .
and not to mention the shower drain was terrible .
the chicken dish is very tasty .
steak was good , cooked perfectly with a decent sauce .
our room was no winner either .
it put me off my feed and i had to leave .
rude at the front desk check in and check out .
i highly recommend the salmon dish .
i wont be returning for a long long long time , if ever .
the restaurant is pretty .
wolfgang always does me right ... ... ... .
this is one of the best restaurant that i ever visited in las vegas .
great selection of small plates , tapas , always crowded .
then he goes , '' ok , i get it .
silly , i know , but i felt really bad .
she is very talented and very personable .
also the bartender jason is also one of the best .
wonderful deco , food , and experience .
i will continue to give them my business !
i ended up demanding another room because of how they handled it .
no wi-fi and room service stops at 2pm !
great food , wonderful prices .
but - it is cheap .
free wifi is always a plus for me .
the parking facilities are atrocious .
great people watching here , especially if you sit by the mall side .
the waitstaff is great .
the breakfast they serve at _num_ is amazing !
is n't ross a department store ?
the house band on sunday night was amazing .
though she talks when she does it , her work is legit !
this is by far the best wig shop i have ever been too .
i was gone all _num_ days just about .
an absolute waste of _num_ bucks .
i only gave this locations stars because i had to .
the beer is cold and the bartenders are great !
thank you to sunrise children 's for our awesome er care today .
not even this lady could keep a straight face on the dick 's spot .
they have the nasty sushi but no wasabi available .
i will definitely come back to this macy 's .
rooms are okay , not that clean .
she stated my primary doctor ordered the wrong test and also not enough tests .
he loved his too !
great happy hour prices .
there were no prices posted anywhere .
full bar , and prices are reasonable too .
i love their shrimp ceviche and empanadas !
the cups are great quality and you can refill for a minimal price .
wow i 'm really surprised at the previous reviews !
every single staff member was courteous , caring , and encouraging .
it 's a great place to start or end your evening .
fast and decent food .
the drinks have such good combinations and offer free samples to taste the flavors .
great gallery in the miracle mile .
only _num_ check in agents .
their rates are n't nearly cheap enough to justify the extreme poor customer service .
customer service at this hotel is absolutely horrible .
this hotel has no customer services at all .
now i 'm at home , in pain with no meds .
cant wait till tomorrow i will be there to enjoy those baseball size shrimp !
the atmosphere is awesome !
we loved how they blast you with cool air as you walk in .
consistently great quality ... .
she stated she would input them and she may come back with more questions .
it is worth it just to go for the `` show . ''
do not take this risk .
fortunately it was n't long till we were seated .
loud neighbors and drunk people .
loud neighbors and drunk people .
highly recommend ordering both and sharing .
this is the worst hotel stay my entire life .
this is the worst hotel stay my entire life .
the rooms are clean and the staff is friendly .
do n't get lied to like i did !
service was timely and the food was pretty good .
the location did n't disappoint .
overall , a very depressing atmosphere .
we had a complimentary cauliflower soup from the chef - whoa so good .
this tapas place is really good .
service was very good , got us in without reservations .
i got a mango frozen drink from this place .
room just looks cheap .
it 's a big cigar shop no no and something that should n't happen .
have stayed at excalibur many times throughout the years .
always a must stop on a vegas trip !
always get the extra shot and feel free to mix flavors .
will not stay here again .
will not stay here again .
excalibur really has done a awful job making their guest feel safe and appreciated .
i always felt safe and saw plenty of security .
great food at extremely reasonable prices !
end of story i would not go back to this place ever again .
also , the timeshare people are pushy and annoying .
loved the workout facility and spa , never overcrowded and always clean .
i would recommend the pizza .
this place is terrible !
i would say the worst was that the ac did not work !
will not be visiting harrahs in the future .
this is beyond ridiculous .
this is beyond ridiculous .
items stolen valued at approximately $ _num_ .
also it 's $ _num_ for a bottle of water .
honestly ca n't go wrong with anything on the menu .
loved their chicken wings !
food was pretty good .
food was pretty good .
there were not many figures , and was not worth the money .
the nurses were very pleasant and polite .
they were also way too long .
that is pretty damn impressive !
the sushi was adequate , and the calamari was appalling .
not sure we will go back .
i stayed the royal tower rooms which are not nice .
i 've stayed in the updated tower and the ridiculously outdated tower .
food was just not that good .
that 's the only reason i gave it one star .
i had the steak and eggs , which came with hash browns .
so it could n't have been that bad .
everyone always compliments my nails .
our driver was friendly and knowledgeable .
there is no coffee pot in your room and that sucks too .
the drinks were strong and tasty .
special thanks to the host staff at the front who were very hospitable !
i called to request the connecting rooms and they were confirmed without a problem .
my favorite salon in all of las vegas !
i 'll definitely come back to this place next time i 'm in vegas !
she brings back our cesar salads which are bland and tasteless at best .
the simple dishes worked best for us .
it 's well worth the visit off the strip !
ended up back at the room later in the night .
hmmm maybe excalibur is this way on purpose .
very happy about that .
the buffet was totally disappointing .
as for the `` baja fresh '' , was horrible .
the flavors are overly complex , overly sweet and unimpressive .
the lost and found department closed sundays by 4pm .
_num_ ) yes , you can print your boarding passes .
then you can hit vegas !
this is actually a rating for the restaurant .
the lights were so dim that you could barely see anything .
it was a great decision .
the service was great and we would definitely return .
i will not be back .
it 's a fantastic place to get drunk off cheap drinks .
highly recommend this company .
the vibe is so cool .
if you have ever had any sushi in your life do n't come here .
this place is an absolute delight .
buyers beware you have been warned .
he made us feel comfortable throughout the process .
plus walking through the forum shops is a nice walk .
loved how the service did n't rush us .
the owners were very friendly and made us feel welcomed .
not so much for me .
the brats were tasteless .
see , you still might win that parent of the year award .
i had a bahama mama drink and was so tasty .
jenny did such a wonderful job .
the employee turnover rate is ridiculous .
nice variety of baked goods .
i got there at _num_ pm and a line was starting to form .
it was like pulling teeth to get any service there .
great off the strip alternative walking distance to lots of restaurants .
holy cow this place is gross !
management would n't lift a finger about the terrible situation .
the price of this hotel and the location are unbeatable .
i love their chicken soup also very delicious .
this is what we ordered and 4-6 steak and mushrooms !
cody park is my favorite artist to work with .
the kitchen was very slow , the food portion sizes confusing and somewhat disappointing .
the room had no coffee machine and no wifi .
the pineapple infused margarita is the best !
we had the best time !
try it , you will love it .
not even a clock radio .
waitress was fine , not overly friendly or helpful .
delicious food and terrific service .
value _num_ stars , they make us good offers that we ca n't refuse .
disgusting and filthy dirty carpets in the guest rooms .
their sangria is sooo good !
he 's got so much energy and has a great personality !
everything we tried was fantastic .
i would never bring my kids to vegas otherwise .
it 's totally worth it & i left full !
i stayed here the past month and did not like it at all .
service is always great here and today was no exception .
the other guest would have access to my room & would have came in .
this was a great hotel experience .
there were lots of good options .
needless to say , great customer service can get you a fat sale .
it 's definitely worth it .
smelly and musty , the rooms are old and made my clothing smell .
instead of apologizing to us , they questioned us .
i figured how bad can it be ?
i visited this restaurant with an associate , it was a great experience .
first of all the tv in the room was n't even working .
the staff at dr green 's office is awesome -- super friendly and accommodating .
waiter had us brilliant suggestions on the cocktail and entre choices .
but one sour waiter makes for a lemon of a meal .
the service is friendly and attentive .
the casino is big , but is dated .
my first firefly experience was at the downtown location and it was amazing .
i would n't stay here again .
called front desk , promised it would be fixed by noon .
we also thought the price was very reasonable for such a lovely dining experience .
i could see the rat pack eating here and enjoying it .
that did n't turn on .
and they did n't even check there work .
i was able to keep my connection going at all time .
recommend eating in the restaurant for a more intimate dining experience .
very good asian fusion cuisine .
tapas is a great option for a snack or light dinner .
our monorail ride was clean , quiet , and quick .
completely exceeded all expectations !
my room was on floor _num_ , tower one .
rooms need a little tlc though .
she made checking in so quick and easy so thank you .
the food court is very reasonable with decent food .
on the second day we realized that the walls are not sound proof .
overall , the service was poor .
too dated , too dark .
i also love the burger for lunchtime .
however , that said , the food was really good .
and the burger is worse now .
returned to our room at 3pm and there has n't been any maid service .
i love the ambience of this place !
food is so fun and delicious .
he was very friendly and knowledgeable about eh menu .
black mold under the sink and on the cabinet .
the rooms are decent .
this year was a little different and we probably wo n't be back .
but the best part about this place is the atmosphere .
i went here after reading all the yelp reviews .
they make you laugh and offer drinks you may like .
then the real fun starts !
it is worth the wait !
both were the best i 've ever had .
pitchers of sangria and mojitos were good .
true the decor is beyond tacky .
great cost and great service .
those people probably live in a barn .
i stayed at the excalibur in november _num_ - not a great experience .
the service was fast and the food excellent !
save yourself some trouble and take your business elsewhere .
enjoyed first visit went back for a second not disappointed .
the food was good and the waitress was really attentive .
i stayed here for _num_ nights and i regretted every one of them .
the food , service , and view was all very good .
both were very delicious !
you can find better hotels with better security .
loved the stuffed dates !
the time to get an appointment is very long .
it was really a lovely , relaxing restaurant stop off-strip .
i got lucky - i got emily !
i love their blended drinks .
the butcher refused to sell me anything under _num_ pounds .
i 'm not wasting my time even going back to her .
they did n't even cook it all the way .
definitely an extensive tropical drink menu which i can definitely appreciate .
orange chicken tasted stale , very stale .
will not stay here again , there are better options at the strip .
we had a beautiful morning breakfast early at this great spot .
in fact none of our food was hot !
i sure as hell do n't and i am in sales .
also the cuban bread appetizer is so good .
oh & mind you , none of the management cares .
the salesman did n't even offer me a test drive .
the barbacoa is fantastic , incredibly tender .
a time piece for everyone .
there are n't a lot of great restaurants .
the waitress was just as bad as the hostess - rude rude rude .
we have visited less and less because of it .
our lobster came still half alive ... slimy and not cooked .
the busser was a better `` waiter '' than our actual waiter .
buffet is nothing to write home about .
their drinks are fun , strong , and tasty .
great for a girls night or a date night .
it tasted almost rotten .
the fries are so good .
i enjoyed eating lunch here .
it 's a very warm atmosphere and i highly recommend it .
the only upside is there are $ _num_ tables .
is n't this what we paid $ _num_ for ?
i just love this place .
i just love this place .
and she almost ordered the wrong photos because of her lack of attention .
i would never eat there again and would probably not stay there either .
by far one of the best lunch places i have been to .
super modern white design , but still cosy and not too big .
reservations are a must as the place fills up with mostly the younger crowd .
flatbread had no flavor .
poor quality , even for a denny 's .
we were in vegas for my birthday and a co-worker recommended this place .
food was tasty and margaritas were refreshing .
this place is awesome !
this place is awesome !
this place is awesome !
this place is awesome !
i could not understand why dirty linens were folded and stocked on the cart .
fun , affordable , and tasty .
the tables are hit or miss and the amount of smoke is ridiculous .
i had high hopes for this diner , i wish it had been better .
the human food is well-priced .
find a hotel with parking security , saves you more money in the end .
ridiculous how unprofessional he was .
the real problem is the restaurant itself .
the best dinner so far in las vegas .
i will never come back here and will recommend ppl avoid this place !
somehow they managed to mess this one up .
the chicken fingers were typical frozen chicken .
we have had a bad experience since day one at this hotel .
also good for kids with arcade and shows .
the price was incredibly reasonable for the caliber of meal you get too !
anita is a very nice and attentive server .
overall we had a great time here !
either way it does the body right !
it was fine for one night but i will not stay there again .
good food n fast .
i was hoping for a truly legendary cheese steak experience .
i love everything about this place .
enjoyed the rest of it in the morning in the hotel room .
will come back again and again .
but this location is very dirty .
i would 've really had been pissed if we were sat facing a wall .
they have tasty breakfasts at a far more reasonable price than the strip .
hubby 's grandma had the seafood chowder and loved it .
staff is very helpful and friendly .
also : vegas is not disney , folks .
here comes the biggest problem ... .
the food as expected is superb .
too thick and not much flavor , other than the gorgonzola on top .
this is a must when you go to las vegas !
dumb move we left him in the room & went out on the town .
did n't stay at harrah 's , but loved gambling there .
the calamari and tuna were really amazing .
not coming back ever again .
they do n't even deserve _num_ star .
they were tasteless and smelled like old beef .
it 's fun to win prizes here .
no fridge in the room .
this was not explained to us and is a huge rip off .
this place was such a disappointment on so many levels .
hotel hell should come to this place and help them .
the rating is solely based on experience with the general manager - mike wong .
the service was fast and friendly as well .
the bed and furniture could be more comfortable .
definitely not a way to end your trip .
all the flavors here are equally fantastic so pick anything .
great time with the kids ... .
staff was friendly and helpful .
staff was friendly and helpful .
dear ross , can i please have the sale price ?
seriously , i do .
checking in earlier costs money - $ _num_ .
higher tier rooms are of better quality .
view over the strip was nice .
`` yea and can i get one for my girlfriend too ?
good times ... love them drinks !
i always recommend firefly on paradise .
great little people watching spot to boot .
i wish employees would be more friendly and open to the guests .
consistency in food preparation does not exist between locations .
a great place for a late night dinner .
the scallops are amazing and everyone must have the beet salad .
all in all we will be back !
my appointment was at _num_ o'clock .
honestly , i would never pick excalibur to stay at .
it was really loud and crowded .
a fun and easy way to go between parts of the vegas strip .
it has great appetizers .
the service is so good at spago .
the girl who helped us check in was very helpful .
just want to qualify my review before i get into it .
i thought it was fine .
my eye shadow was beautiful !
oh , no wifi either .
i went to las vegas for a small valentines getaway with my boyfriend .
the wait time happened twice .
do n't risk staying here no matter how good the deal is !
almost like they just did n't care ?
especially love the late night happy hour !
i called guest services and they were really rude to me about it .
i walked in with very specific requirements for new work shoes .
gave us great recommendations on sushi and saki .
excalibur did not live up to expectation .
um , the lamp still has a pull down string to turn it on .
are you kidding me ?
are you kidding me ?
are you kidding me ?
are you kidding me ?
are you kidding me ?
stayed here a few years ago and it was horrible .
the food itself was very tasty .
so would n't i just be able to build a margherita pizza ?
a little pricey but well worth it !
i will definitely go back ... wish they had this place in ca .
a good business hotel .
another typical bad sign is when you ca n't order directly from the chef .
was pleasantly surprised by large drink and food menu .
it was a great deal and nights not available to the public .
a lovely employee ignored and walked past by us .
i have been here maybe _num_ times .
they also have amazing cocktails .
love , love , love this place .
lousy atmosphere and sketchy cooks .
good food with a great atmosphere !
this is a good deal !
this restaurant should be called rice rolls _num_ not sushi _num_ .
that guy is just incredible !
that comes out to $ _num_ .
i would come back , as long as i do n't have him again .
i think the hotel staff should put an application in to work there .
we wanted to take a nap after we checked in .
the food was pretty disgusting .
the food at the buffet was mediocre , but had a large selection .
but my last trip to mac was outstanding .
made me utterly sick .
this place has sandwiches that are overpriced and is drowned in cheese whiz .
i would never stay there again .
best way to get around vegas to the premier stops you want to make .
i was there for two hours and only _num_ other shoppers .
got the octane one , and it was strong but not too strong !
sent it back and came back less salty .
the rice was dry and had a salty after taste .
these guys are great !
i do n't think i 'll bother going back to this store again .
avoid at all costs unless you are drunk .
friendly , funny , and helpful , it was an excellent shopping experience !
the service was phenomenal .
the lady was very rude and tried to get me off the phone .
also rooms a little worn .
the tar tar was absolutely delicious i recommend that item first and foremost .
the owners are super cool .
i have received no phone call or e mail and its been _num_ weeks .
wine was superb as was the service .
i 'd rather pay more money for a better experience .
i am totally disappointed that this is what the new harrahs has become .
to think we were sleeping on that is disgusting !
my feet are really rough as i am a runner .
absolutely love this place !
a bit pricey , but worth it .
we had rob as our instructor and he was great !
in spite of casino 's low rating i really enjoyed this casino .
as far as casino hotels in vegas go , this is one of them .
i highly recommend the dates , empanadas , and chorizo stuffed mushrooms !
every aspect was amazing .
not up to my standards especially since i work in the industry .
the bathroom had poor water pressure .
not to mention the huge arcade downstairs !
like i say , getting in and out of there now is a nightmare .
you got ta give it a try .
thank you for your great hospitality and service .
everything tastes freshly made .
by far the worst service i 've ever experienced during a stay in vegas .
the customer service here was outstanding .
preferred the flamingo from previous trip .
all her over services are great too , lol .
primo , i 'm not a fan of carpets where you serve food .
most likely will not be coming here again .
had a lot of delicious food here .
we will return the next time we are in vegas !
this has to be the worst place in vegas .
sad to say i will never book another reservation thru hotels.com ever .
the arcade smelled like mildew & made me want to gag .
food quality is average at best preparation completely uneven .
casino is ok , everything is just out dated .
i love this hotel ... .
worth the trip from the strip .
we ordered _num_ different tapas , as well as alcoholic beverages .
this is a casual mexican place inside the venetian hotel .
their prices are outstanding , and the service is awesome !
after the second course i asked my waiter when does my wine pairing start .
i 'm hard pressed to remember service as bad i experienced at this hotel .
great beds great staff .
horrible place nobody go here .
the smell of smoke was everywhere .
they recommended pistachio and i enjoyed it .
the one underground at the mgm was great .
not welcoming at all .
this was my favorite meal in vegas .
room was nice as well as free wifi and free breakfast .
they know my coffee , great service .
i am so put out with this place .
it is a great place for children to win toys and adults to gamble .
and he made sure i had a comfortable and delicious meal .
the food was surprisingly pretty good .
smelled like smoke when no smoking room .
we left somewhat disappointed .
no one was there !
fantastic food at any hour love this place !
thank you for a great start to the day !
this place has really gone downhill since i last stayed here .
the food was nothing special .
my biggest problem was the room .
i have n't been here in years - the food and service was great .
pizza hut or any national chain has better pizza based fare than this place .
i had the house stromboli and my wife had chicken wings and fries .
service was impeccable , very fast and friendly .
unless you have kids , no .
she should n't even have one to begin with .
as most of vegas , the hotel smells like smoke .
i was highly offended that as my server she could n't communicate with us .
they really provide top-notch services .
thank you so much !
thank you so much !
everything on the menu is my favorite here !
: ) the coconut shrimp is recommended as well ... !
fish across the board was not very fresh .
stayed here for _num_ days .
it was a stunning disappointment .
i was there for _num_ hours .
we will be staying here next time !
next time i 'll bring my own polish and tools though .
the mood is pretty chill .
great food in small and very affordable .
request waiter adrian , he 's very caring and has great customer service .
they also had too much salt in their batter or seasoning .
bathrooms get overcrowded and filthy inside like a college football game .
improving gambling and comps would make you more competitive .
we ordered a lamb sandwich , a pizza , and a chopped salad .
and yes another kid friendly place !
slow service but semi professional .
with excellent service and reasonable prices .
wow the food was amazing the sliders !
definitely one of the more touristy things about vegas .
i will never stay or even enter this hotel again .
that 's not my issue .
i really enjoyed myself .
i enjoyed my experience here with my girlfriend .
that goes to show their still misleading customers .
this is really a must have for a day in vegas !
half yard _num_ with an add shot .
although the rates are good , i just spent three nights there .
the room was an upgrade , but only in the tv and granite counters .
the problem remains is that the entire tower _num_ needs to be renovated .
do n't expect anything remotely good from this place .
we just stayed _num_ nights at this hotel .
looks great with the remodel !
i think any toddler is familiar with the difference between crackers and bread .
got same reception when we checked out on monday .
best recommended for a hungry night and special occasion dining .
the shelves and racks are empty .
the pictures are horribly overpriced and you are forced to buy a package .
the carpet is dirty and worn out the fixtures are also old and worn .
the staff was superb and the food was really good .
helped me out with everything i needed & was super friendly .
the food here was good and unique !
i ordered delivery , my food showed up missing items .
most vegas establishments have great service .
being from nyc it 's really hard to find a good bagel out here !
the stole my mother in laws purse and my daughters purse .
if u gamble do n't waste ur money to any total rewards casino !
the risotto was watery and too salty .
thoroughly disgusted with their pathetic hotel and security staff .
proximity to the strip was n't bad .
we had a party of _num_ ; _num_ adults and _num_ children .
its dirty , and smelly the moment you walk in .
drinks are pretty strong ... especially the mojito .
so yeah , i ca n't recommend specific dishes because i like them all .
he just threw to my husband 's hands and immediately walked away .
couple people ordered a special salmon , which was great as well .
the classic salad was unique in that it had so many vegetable finely chopped .
it was that bad !
it did n't disappoint !
my friends meatball sandwhich was cold .
he was so knowledgable of the area and kept us entertained .
i had a great experience and was in and out in a flash .
i ca n't believe it .
poor delivery and preparation for this event definitely gives this place _num_ star .
the hotel itself is n't too bad .
first time here with my wife .
it was n't enough for us to stay again .
i did n't even get an apology which is so crazy .
the food was overpriced and not very tasty .
our servers were perfect .
i get this happens and we get into our room .
they told me to speak to a hotel manager , yet none were available .
there are two empty tables next to us .
great atmosphere , right by the canal .
the place has been around awhile and is pretty dated .
it 's a pretty nice arcade with a good number of choices .
and they have awesome sangria !
good location for strip visitors .
helped me find just the right thing ... the boyfriend jeans .
food is also very good .
soaked in hot sauce and served on foam plates .
i do n't recommend .
good atmosphere , amazing happy hour and staff are friendly too .
my room did n't have an internet cable .
having said that i am sorely disappointed in this arby 's .
all of the dishes were perfectly seasoned and i would definitely recommend this place !
they have free breakfast which is good .
pros : beds were comfortable and cheap .
it was such a horrible and disgusting experience !
jason gave us top notch service -- something we have come to expect .
the store is well organized & pretty quiet when i was there .
great way to spend time with friends ringing in the new year .
not just great food , but great people !
love the mid strip location with the monorail stop .
again i experienced a well prepared meal here at bahama breeze !
the price is the only thing this place has going for itself .
i called and called and they said no no nope .
was n't so happy & excited .
around the same price so i wo n't be staying here again .
it 's an old hotel , so i was n't expecting much .
the theme was just so ridiculous .
great location in the forum shops and all of the food smelled amazing .
i love mgm properties , but this place is garbage !
she sent me to the platinum line , where i still had to wait .
bacon wrapped dates stuffed with almonds and blue cheese - wow !
i was n't expecting mgm style .
i enjoyed riding the monorail .
do n't waste your time or money !
fourth , the food itself was quite mediocre , at best .
also , there is someone trying to sell you something every _num_ feet !
i do not like their nasty restroom !
nice selection of exotic tropical cocktails .
highly recommend and def have the martini !
overall this place just needs to go away .
i was happy all right .
the food , when i finally ate it was n't that good .
the room was spacious and there was nothing wrong .
she is the worst doctor i 've seen .
personally i do not recommend this place for the price .
this place does n't even come close .
we love this place !
we love this place !
but our other coworker did not .
manager was rude , grumpy and unapologetic .
the pool area is small but really nice .
overall , harrah 's is a terrible hotel .
the ambiance brings it all together : ) wonderful find outside of the strip .
they were unable to put sheets on our bed .
made me lose my appetite .
i like the concept of the castle but not the way they executed it .
very old vegas , love it !
no agent would ever break a rule ! ''
the food here is great ... i loved almost everything we ordered .
you get great service from the bartender .
this is the perfect place to work on giving out a fake name .
service was friendly but so-so .
i love their chunky , spicy salsa .
we had the flan which was very good .
i really enjoyed my stay at harrah 's !
what really bothered me about this place ( more than already mentioned ) .
luckily managed to finish _num_ % of it all .
good restaurant , friendly and competent service , the food was really good .
i knew i should have book at mgm again .
the instructors are amazing !
i asked for some bread which was also really good .
it 's a great place for kids .
this place has great prices for a nice vegas restaurant .
and yet i do n't care i refuse to wait in line any longer .
the dessert menu was superb .
they have an amazing selection of things .
the checkin was about _num_ people -- it was insane !
excellent margaritas ( just say you do n't want it sweet ) .
this may be my favorite banana of them all .
the roll did n't even taste all the fresh at all .
rainbow trout can definitely use some assistance with seasoning .
probably the best thing we did on our trip .
it is what it is , especially for $ _num_ a night .
everything we had was so good !
great location and i love gambling at the casino .
she was rude and just so cold .
everything is good , but i had the bacon wrapped dates which were amazing !
all of these items were brand new .
the room was mediocre .
plus the line was crazy long and i did n't feel like waiting .
we noticed that they took out the trash but did n't clean our room .
it 's everywhere on the strip .
service is a bit lax but pleasant .
my find your phone service showed the phone was turned off in that store .
the owners really help you .
the staff is always so friendly and the food is amazing !
services was good too everyone was friendly !
i know , for $ _num_ .
i 've had everything on the menu twice and recommend it all .
they 're great , and the kids are very happy .
we could hear our loud neighbors .
thanks for the great service alex !
the best hospital to give birth in las vegas .
i understand thorough , but thorough can be done quickly .
their sangria was also pretty amazing .
most expensive dining experience ever .
carrie from graveyard is the best !
unless you are on a very low budget and every other hotel is booked .
highly recommend a room above the casino .
they have a great weekday happy hour .
and my comforter had a cigarette burn on it .
one of my favorite extras for my sandwich as well as chipotle sauce !
the burritos were humongous and delicious and the chicken enchiladas were amazing !
one of my favorite places in las vegas .
great and convenient nonetheless ... try it out .
towels were very thin and stained .
the bread they serve you before the meal is also yummy !
nice way to cool off from the hot strip .
my insurance must of sent the referral over _num_ times .
the employees are rude due partially to ownership changes over the last _num_ years .
the food was amazing , but the service is what will make me return .
the bed is really hard and uncomfortable .
i spent $ _num_ for inside and outside .
not good at all .
the only thing that tasted good was the coleslaw .
terrible management , terrible food , terrible rooms !
great food and nice staff .
pretty good casual place off the strip , a huge locals hangout .
i would n't recommend this hotel , if you could avoid it .
the customer service is horrific , especially for a vegas hotel .
this spot is a joke .
i thought he was great .
great location , delicious fish entres and very good service !
beware - poorly run operation here .
i ate here this week and brought very good clients .
my boyfriend and i love the place .
_num_ a night good deal through our event we did on sat .
they will give you a dessert in celebration .
_num_ stars sonny 's - the best !
this one was easily the worst .
one of the best shopping experiences i 've had in years .
the staff is so nice & helpful !
i love tapas and this place had a great selection and atmosphere .
the towels were clean but the beds were horrible !
finally , i flagged down a busboy and asked for the check .
this is n't going to be a positive post .
they 're practically adult drinks with a childhood twist .
the casino was n't anything to write home about .
oh good lord , this place has n't changed in ages .
this was n't just our problem .
one of my favorite dishes here is the quesadilla ( see attached photo ) .
the thermostat did n't do an actual , comfortable temperature .
if you 're in vegas , do n't stay here .
for an upscale establishment , it is perfect for every occasion .
are they just making the beds and not changing the sheets ?
wait time is over _num_ hours , and we are still in line .
found a cilantro jalapeo margarita that my husband almost cried it was so good .
not too bad of a hike unless you 're stuck in _num_ degree heat .
bad service , over priced and quality of the food is bad .
it has great parking !
there 's a very nice lady who runs this store .
the drinks here are delicious though !
the service is just as great as well .
appropriate decor but be a little better .
it was a great value for what we got for it .
no coffee maker , not even glasses so we could drink .
ok , the casino is not that great .
these touches are the nice cherry on top of an amazing dining experience .
wine recommended by our server was perfect for our snack .
the room was so small and so was everything else in the room .
you can always catch us in store or ordering our latest online .
this is by far , my favorite mexican restaurant .
also , the cleaning lady did n't do anything but give us new towels .
( i 'm from vegas , we 're special kind of people . )
fortunately , the bill that was presented had a survey on it .
mall shopping is fun with drink in hand !
yes , this walgreens has a nice selection of liquor .
overall i would not stay here again .
i was pleasantly surprised !
ok , so this location is like the size of my living room .
my condo company booked it for me .
best customer service ever !
i loved they were family owned and operated and vegas locals !
`` no , your staff sent me here . ''
everything we had was good .
i did not have fun .
we were also very disappointed in the lack of security .
all in all , we had a horrible trip .
misleading advice from calling earlier to get seated for minimal wait time .
_num_ hours to check in !
i paid $ _num_ for a hand wash .
there is something for everyone on the menu .
the attention to detail was amazing .
it was my first time having sparkling wine sangria .
tasty chips and guacamole .
attentive and friendly staff .
this place is a great eatery .
i 'd recommend to everyone !
the rooms are small and nothing special .
when i checked out me total was _num_ .
i heard of stories of people waiting almost _num_ hours .
employees are very friendly .
buffet is crap , do not do the breakfast or lunch buffet .
my girl was amazing and understood what i wanted .
but they pretty much ruined my christmas eve .
family and adult friendly .
and no one mentioned to compensate us !
with that said , that was some good italian food .
i never knew mexican food can be so varied and exotic .
it serves its purpose in life !
it 's wednesday , and i have n't got anything from them .
definitely worth the trip .
the most musty stale smell ever !
very disappointing , excalibur , very disappointing .
this is by far the worst serves ever !
i looked around the store and she was nowhere to be found .
everything was pretty tasty especially my favorite mac & cheese .
well , here it is , another day and no phone call .
the chopped salad was excellent .
not as good as i remembered .
secondly , the cake was terribly bland .
i must admit , it was cheap .
at this time , we already lost our appetite .
i 've also enjoyed their creme brle and souffl .
this is just unacceptable .
the signature margarita drink was very good , not too sweet .
really nice , warm staff .
i 've never been to a hotel that does n't serve past 2pm .
i 've bought from every shop in town and they are the cheapest .
the pizza was delicious .
not fond of sangria but theirs is the best .
perhaps one of the most fun shopping experiences i 've ever had .
it just felt blah inside .
they wanted to charge me _num_ as if i was getting a discount .
this is not a trustworthy or honest business .
one may not notice .
omg the drink rocked !
that said , the customer service is appalling .
one of my favorite restaurants in vegas !
that sauce they are cooked in is absolutely amazing .
i look natural and felt comfortable at the store .
in serious need of refreshing though ; it was quite dated .
it was a disaster .
love their oreo shake .
i 'll definitely be back when i 'm want to buy a new bag !
i love this tapas place.
i love that it is a local establishment that serves good quality food .
a very sad mgm property .
it was also extremely salty .
its was ok but not that great .
my first day when i arrived in the room it was _num_ degrees .
my goodness is this place run terribly .
this place has character and class , i will be back !
not a fan of the bathroom situation though .
in the forum and definetly worth it .
the only good part was the crepes made to order !
it is fine if you do n't really know food .
the only thing i liked about this hotel was the casino and location .
easily best bagels and lox in vegas .
a tired convention center in need of a tear down and remake .
great experience for the kids .
i forgot to mention that he has an amazing staff .
the server was amazing .
overall , enjoyable , they have very good specialty drinks .
this food is so delicious !
overall it was a fun time and the kids loved it .
the excalibur has a major con : it is way too smokey .
my aunt was in shock and she was embarrassed .
we stayed here for about _num_ days .
thank goodness for good food !
at first , i was extremely excited to go to this wax museum .
we gave this place a 2nd shot and were disappointed again .
one of the best kept secrets in vegas .
the service and food were impeccable .
love love love this wig shop !
i have never tasted anything so yummy and so strong before !
super delicious and fruity and it gives you one hell of a buzz !
easy parking and all the people work there are very nice and helpful .
casino and room hallway smell .
once the food brought out , but wrong order .
over the past year the food has really gone downhill .
the bagels fresh and flavorful .
this is an awesome restaurant .
firefly has possibly the best sangria i 've had in my entire life !
the room was dark and gave out a `` haunted '' feelings .
i stayed in tower _num_ a few months ago and the elevators were dirty .
come on now , that 's just unacceptable !
very unappetizing to see .
i have n't stayed here since i was a child .
_num_ octane and hurricane mixed is amazing .
plus they still had plenty of breakfast food left .
cheap , feels dirty , and quality is just not there .
food is great and always professional and courteous thru out the process .
there is a tv in the restroom but no remote for it .
facing the other tower .
even the bread was fantastic .
the best place to have dinner .
he explained the different watches and their materials with lots of knowledge and detail .
you can eat here and drink and still have money to gamble .
did not contest the sign on the door .
the work put into it is just amazing .
at least in a motel you get a real bed .
very nice place to grab a lunch .
the casino smell so bad , the cigarette smoke was terrible .
the room i was sent to was already damaged .
there were _num_ other cars behind me !
the food was really good and the service was great .
sit down , little boys and girls and let me tell you a story .
perfect place to relax with soothing live music , delicious food and great cocktails .
i would recommend everyone trying this out for something unique to do .
one of my favorite restaurants in vegas .
$ _num_ for a drink and he wanted to charge me for a refill .
you must eat here if you love food and fun .
everything is going to crap now !
i was so excited to try this las vegas landmark .
my next step with this is complaining to each casino about this company .
i booked his hotel for my first visit to vegas .
my family of _num_ had a great time .
see my other yelp under forum shops !
could have been a bit better in price .
_num_ stars : best flautas in the world !
the service personnel in this hotel also had bad attitudes .
the chowder was excellent .
what an overall bad experience .
warning , i am going to write a book .
not spending my money at a place like that .
you made our dinner a great experience !
service started out a bit spotty , but got better as we settle in .
honestly , this is probably my favorite restaurant in the world .
so i really really really wanted a philly cheese steak tonight .
i wish i was exaggerating - but i 'm not .
they made such a small request seem like a huge inconvenience .
best transportation for your $ $ $ .
room is outdated and not properly cleaned .
stopped by with friends for lunch .
a very good restaurant .
everything was delicious and the service was good .
mojitos are good too .
it 's the best thing ever .
a lot to be desired .
us wigs has a vast selection of blonde wigs which i really like .
it 's worth every minute .
the shoes and socks are very reasonable and the help is very good .
the hotel does n't look that great or fancy from the outside .
all of which were exceptional ) .
i thoroughly enjoyed the ambience and food and will definitely return .
easy access , parking , clean and spacious rooms and free breakfast .
let 's not forget the crappy food choices !
this port of subs is great .
i also could n't help but notice that everything was n't freshly prepared .
is lettuce not in season ?
so check them out !
stayed at harrahs last weekend , the beds were amazing !
we took our kids and we all had a blast !
we just got wings , and they were very good .
this is one of the best hidden gems in vegas .
when i had eaten all i could , there was still alot left over .
this is a great place for a date .
said it 's a `` reasonable '' italian place with great food .
i highly recommend this shop .
this is one of the best places i have eaten in las vegas .
now i remember why i do n't try new places .
every course was nicely presented and taste great .
the smoked salmon pizza was the perfect breakfast/lunch combo .
my car was not cleaned at all .
it 's a total shame that the hotel does this .
my favorite happy hour in las vegas .
i ended up drinking almost an entire pitcher last time i went !
i actually enjoyed my stay here .
this place is awesome for the taste and the deal !
the first thing i noticed was that she orders lots of tests .
only old school cable internet .
it is n't available after _num_ p.m .
but the drinks contained almost no alcohol .
over-priced food and an overall lack of caring .
the staff in the office was crap .
i 'm very happy with their service .
the food came in big portions and was delicious .
boy , was i wrong !
we were so close to everything and that is exactly what we wanted .
go a couple times a year whenever in town .
it was so bad that even the dessert was horrible .
great waitstaff , attentive , not pushy .
anyway , service was okay .
best food i had in vegas my whole trip .
wife enjoyed the curry shrimp .
i felt so beautiful !
this was very valuable for traveling the strip while i stayed at bally 's .
the food was so good and the waiter was super nice .
clean shop but we walked out b/c of the owner .
the people are great , very comfortable , homely atmosphere , very welcoming .
omg , i really dont know how these guys are still in business .
beef dishes - especially sirloin are very good .
_num_ ) where is the wifi ?
toys r us has gone down the hole over the years .
it 's fast , it 's convenient , and it 's easy !
entree 's came out during salads , waters were empty and staff was absent .
this is the last time i 'll choose to pickup at this store .
just really really loudly ... .
newer casinos have bathrooms placed better along the gaming floor .
`` sorry , are we bothering you ? ''
overall , i enjoyed my stay .
yes yes the real caesar 's palace ... in las vegas at least .
i had a great time at circus circus , the rooms are priced accordingly .
and the crowd is pretty great !
i 'll keep this short and sweet .
no wifi offered either .
their signature firefly fries are a bit greasy but quite tasty .
ended up staying here as my original vacation date changed due to work .
great people watching for sure .
but oh well ... to each is own .
another thing that has become really irritating is the endless sales pitch .
wasnt impressed this time cheese burger overcooked and dry , fries cold .
the food is always fresh and of quality .
the gentleman said he still did n't have any other rooms available .
chunks of fresh lobster meat rolled in a delicate homemade pasta .
my bath towel smelled like smoke .
my bath towel smelled like smoke .
do not stop there late in the evening .
as has been mentioned before , no wifi either .
stuffy is the word for it .
makes me never want to go back .
very good mexican restaurant .
we love this place and we highly recommend to everyone !
love the jalapeo bagel here !
we 're waiting , and he brings out luggage that is n't ours !
the flavors were fresh , crisp and delicious .
a little bowl of canned veg all and a stale roll .
it is korean owned , and not authentic japanese sushi .
this is the worse pizza i 've ever eaten .
easy cab ride from the strip .
best i can say is disappointing overall .
the store selling starbucks was adequate with a very helpful clerk .
i do n't know why i keep coming in these stores .
we had great service , the bartenders were very attentive and friendly .
the temperature said it was _num_ , but it felt like _num_ .
okay - other than that , there 's really nothing to see .
i love places with a great happy hour , atmosphere , and patio .
she only had _num_ tables so not quite sure why that took so long .
virtually every person was displeased with their room in one way or another .
thank you for all you did for my son .
i also recommend the house made infused vodka on the rocks .
the food is just perfect !
no lie , best drink in vegas !
pricing is as good as it gets as well for all the different sizes .
and some fishy paste , blah !
the food is amazing .
the food is amazing .
oh , and if you want to enjoy the pool - it sucks .
nothing fancy - but the location is perfect !
salad was very good best part was the croutons .
they make you feel very comfortable and help you have a good time .
overall , this hotel is a great deal .
but otherwise i try to avoid it if at all possible .
and do n't get me started about saturday night at the casino .
really , truly gorgeous .
the smells are just different ; coffee , as opposed to the woods .
they are fast , efficient and fair on rice .
i 'll be back for sure , though .
however , i tried something new ... and it was great !
they were not happy .
there is n't enough to parking !
i was so impressed with each servers knowledge of the cuisine they were serving .
they have a wonderful fish with almond crusted yumminess on top .
fat tuesday is always great in the summer !
i have never see someone be so nasty and unprofessional !
plus it 's happy hour !
i love everything about firefly .
its so worth it .
and it did n't cost _num_ bucks for a _num_ dollar hot dog !
the mojitos are excellent !
i have never stayed at harrahs , so figured i 'd try it .
the cocktails were excellent also .
she has good taste and always make trendy recommendations .
the room was huge and very clean .
no new towels for _num_ days .
there are two hotel towers .
overall , it was n't the worst i could have imagined .
sad how poor management can ruin a location .
drinks and food were great !
the room itself to me seemed a little dated .
only complaint is the nose level was quite high .
front row usually has something that fills the bill for me .
it was the perfect place to grab lunch .
it is the best i 've ever had .
the food was amongst the best we have ever had .
loved the bed selection as well !
the wine list is great .
the staff were friendly and informative .
the employees are ok but the manager is incompetent .
paella was super flavorful and filled with substantial amount of seafood .
this was my first time here and i had a pretty good experience .
it was crispy in some places and soggy in the rest .
yet our friends had called _num_ minutes before and got the extra hour .
never again will i go there .
jamaican wings are huge and the sauce is sweet and yummy .
, and we had a great time .
well , i m not standing in line again for sure .
i 'm not a tourist .
the waitresses are nice and the service has always been good .
do yourself a favor -- do n't come here .
stayed here for a few months back in _num_ , and it was great .
great prices and decent wine by the glass .
just another example of why drugs are bad for you kids .
very messy , long lines of people .
ancient creations is a phenomenal place to visit at the venetian .
okay , i admit it , i 've stayed here .
good food , great ambiance and excellent margaritas .
the clerk apologized etc .
he then took _num_ minutes to bring me a side of dressing .
the mushrooms were wonderful .
letting me get even more mad about the situation .
for example , it would be approximately $ _num_ for _num_ breakfast buffets .
bagels are top notch .
our waiter was friendly and attentive too .
even so i had a good time here .
but it 's also a good thing .
it does not feel clean at all .
great food , fast and pleasant service !
there is always something going on and i very highly recommend it .
was recommended by a friend who lives in vegas .
order shots or beer , do not get mixed drinks here .
food is fresh and tasty and very excellent selection .
a fairly large arcade with a good variety of newer games .
good food and good waiting service .
i ordered the french dip sandwich , it was pathetic .
unfortunately that is where the good ends .
i love that i can go to any salon they have in town !
popcorn ceilings and worn carpet show its age .
very clean business , and well lit .
happy hour drinks are half off and you get a free plate of appetizers .
one of my favorite spots .
just regular plain tomato juice .
really bad theme for a gambling casino .
the room looked dim and dingy .
highly recommend this experience !
i know now why the other _num_ locations are permanently closed .
but please never intend to sleep here !
this is my favorite vegas restaurant .
the window shade had holes in it .
the window shade had holes in it .
the entertainment is free at the midway , which is great .
i ordered _num_ pizzas one hand tossed the other thin .
the staff is always nice and makes you feel welcome .
chocolate upside down cake was amazing !
beautiful setting , reasonably priced ( for vegas ) , pretty good service .
i did not receive any of that here .
some of the best calamari you will ever have .
there was a safe though .
then excalibur really dropped the ball !
the service is great and the location is just right off of the strip .
food was alright , not the best .
anyway , at least the food was good !
* check in area is old looking and long lines .
by far the worst experience ever .
had the carbonara by his recommendation and it was delicious !
no wifi in the room .
the beef is so juicy and tender it literally melts off the fork .
our check was handed by another server .
food is amazing ... sangria is amazing !
it took security at least _num_ minutes or more to come to the room .
looks like they parked another car too close .
we decided to grab a fast bite at the food court .
i got _num_ full size beds in a smoking room .
it was another enjoyable meal at bahama breeze !
waitress never came back by to check on us .
excellent food for an excellent price .
the portions were good , service was great .
would n't come back here .
very nice apple store !
drove an extra _num_ miles just based on reviews and worth the drive .
slots were good , tables not good .
their margaritas are awesome , good variety .
a thing i did n't like too much was the size .
just super nice , fast services .
our server joe was awesome as well .
weekend stays are rather more expensive .
but , i had trouble .
not true to the fat burger quality and service anymore .
it 's a nice little break from all that drinking !
our friends ' room was less than clean .
there wasnt even a bathtub in this upgraded room .
the rooms were nice , location was great .
the instructors are superb !
i do n't think it is in the best part of town .
it was delicious with just the right amount of liquor .
the food was delicious , the ambiance romantic .
it 's really not that great anymore .
great for a family or people on budget .
iv never been treated so badly .
seriously , that bad .
the rooms are nice and clean .
but this one has the worst service !
they were both fantastic .
their drink selection is quite special .
i wish i could give zero stars .
this is a restaurant that is a must go to when in vegas !
my husband loved it .
sandwich was super soggy and not enjoyable .
this place is phenomenal !
this place is phenomenal !
get that extra shot for $ _num_ ; it 's worth it .
they have a happy hour ; ) and save room for dessert !
it 'll be okay , she 'll deserve it .
great option for the regular more pricier service offered on the hotels .
i put oil back in my car , and guess what ?
the waitress asked me what was wrong and i explained to her the situation .
super yummy and affordable , with a great vibe .
everything here was awful !
the property is dated .
the cafe menu prices are a little less expensive but the food is exceptional !
_num_ minutes later , still nothing .
i was disappointed that this place had pretty decent reviews after staying there .
i wore flip flops at all times .
i will never come back to this place .
everyone went away happy ( and buzzed ) .
i highly recommend the hotel , since i had an amazing experience .
of $ _num_ per day , during the week .
the food the first time was okay , philly cheese with swiss .
unfortunately , i really did n't like my stay .
you can tell they really pay attention to detail .
go to that one unless you like excessive waiting .
avoid it at all cost !
but he was very offensive to us .
i waited about _num_ days , and no one called .
that being said , this is a great place .
slow to get drinks .
i only played poker but the experience was n't that great .
the elevator entrance reeked of a less than sanitary odor .
should be no star .
want a $ _num_ computer ?
do not eat the food off the grill here .
good prices , service , atmosphere , and taste .
even they looked like they enjoyed working the place .
they were both really good .
however today my burger was more like a slider .
the salad is the best chinese chicken salad that you will eat .
the omelet came with a bagel and diced potatoes .
the decor was awful and reminded of a bad nail salon in the hood .
clean , quiet , speedy .
the food was great - we started off with the steak tartar .
also the traffic can be a nightmare with a big convention .
anyway , on with the review .
i 'll definitely be back for more .
not impressed considering i 'm staying in a castle ... !
the food is so delicious and perfectly sized portions .
this will not fly with locals .
the door nearly hit the toilet when you would close it .
i get one of these a day during every vegas trip !
great service , great atmosphere , great food and drinks and great prices .
it was a real disappointment .
but its a nice little romantic spot to relax with your boo .
overall , this is n't a bad place for the price .
their customer service is horrible !
nice place to eat and relax .
the shower wall has a huge ball of long hair stuck to it .
noodles were cooked perfectly .
gosh , i was so mad !
jason and bob at the bar are awesome people .
i liked the buffet here- flavors was surprisingly good .
i got sick after a day being there real quick .
at $ _num_ and at a prime location , harrah 's is a steal .
they have an awesome menu as well that has something for just about everyone .
service is okay but do n't expect much from such a casual place .
not a fan of this particular location .
worst customer service i have ever ever witnessed .
do n't waist your time or money with these people .
i give this _num_ star just for the outside .
the prices per night are very good anytime of the year .
this is the first time i stayed in an older vegas hotel .
our first room was nasty .
i tried an ahi tuna dish that was very good .
best deal in vegas by far for what you get .
lol it needs to be remodeled .
it was good , but i liked the crab cakes benedict better .
regardless , my impressions of circo were splendid .
they also have the best variety on their menu .
great selection of booze , snacks , and souvenirs !
the employees were soo rude and annoying .
thank you sunrise l & d !
service from the two female bartenders was excellent as well .
not impressed at all with this place and i will not be back .
if you go here , do n't expect anything special .
firefly is a must when i go to las vegas .
the room was just ok .
after suggesting a free upgrade for his birthday , i was rudely shot down .
the food was really good and properly cooked .
very impressed with this apple location .
but even for a free room , i would n't return .
anyway , that 's my experience .
just a complete miss .
this is one of my favorite places to go to !
i 'm normally not a meatloaf person , but it was fantastic .
the salmon entre was over _num_ dollars and it was dry and tasteless .
will definitely be coming back !
will definitely be coming back !
most of the fun and activities will be had in between these two hotels .
told my husband to hit the rain locker because he stunk .
the hotel refused to change my room without any sort of upgrades unfortunately .
i normally tip even for just picking up food from a restaurant but this time.
restaurant was clean and i saw the bus boys cleaning .
_num_ small stromboli and _num_ antipasto salad please .
the food is always consistent and the service is always great .
pathetic is one word to describe this hotel .
it looked so bad after she painted it .
waiter was extremely nice ; very polite and gave great recommendations !
but , it was worth it .
great place to have a good small portioned meal with a lady .
i would certainly eat here again .
this hotel also has the worst dining on the strip .
the yard dog was the perfect size .
always great service - quick service , and very friendly and attendant staff .
the price is great and the memories are plentiful .
service was also super polite and friendly both in the restaurant and bakery side .
i went to use the outlet to charge my phone .
this restaurant has a very hit and trendy environment .
okay , just about everything on the menu , i enjoy good food .
wo n't be going back there again .
wo n't be back .
wo n't be back .
that 's just horrible management and customer service !
customer service from the counter was superb , and the place was spotless .
it was nice to eat somewhere off the strip !
she had never tried any of the food .
would not pay to eat or gamble there .
dessert was the best .
great clothes and customer service to match !
i wish i could give a better review .
oh and do n't forget ... bring your own coffee maker !
to my surprise the food was exceptional .
this hotel is made for a nice long weekend .
they let you sample the drinks before purchasing and the staff is super friendly !
the burrito was really tasty .
never again will i stay in this horror place !
pee in the toilet , towels on the floor .
excellent selection and tastes awesome .
all the staff from check in to photos we friendly and helpful .
the poker room sucked .
it 's still really nice .
highly recommended to anyone and every - delicious !
all that we ordered was delicious and we did n't break the bank .
sliders were mediocre and a little overdone for my taste .
not a good vibe , kinda prison feel .
it is fast and efficient .
no internet , noisy crappy conditioner , no ventilation in the rooms .
this was a very rush job .
the management agreed it was disgusting and yet did nothing about it .
they are the best !
but this does not compare to being scammed twice by the excalibur .
the empanadas and tuna tartare were amazing !
price is very reasonable as well .
just let me walk to the pool in peace , please !
it was like _num_ bucks so i had high expectations .
i immediately called guest services and requested a room change .
the drinks are great and the servers are always friendly !
this is one of my favorite places to eat !
great experience overall and well worth .
i wo n't be making this my go to cheap hotel ever again .
staff is courteous fun and knowledgeable .
all were very good .
all were very good .
luckily i fell under the _num_ day with my lease .
parking for the apple store is best in the green area under saks .
the air conditioner cover was busted off .
it was so irritating .
great experience and so fun !
food tasted good and decor is elegant yet hip .
worst food in history of las vegas buffet .
i saw a women fighting with manager for that issue , which was useless .
it 's a shame that the bus boy had to do all the work .
dan is the slowest and most ill informed person i have ever dealt with .
always get the extra shot ... so worth it .
the view is terrible .
overall , an average dessert and i 've had better .
room was nice and clean !
best italian i have ever had .
so you wo n't be getting these crappy reviews .
within five seconds another tech at the store was able to locate it .
this is the place to go if you like a good frozen cocktail !
each time is same star .
service here is always spot on and much appreciated !
( a room across the hall also complained of stolen items ) .
the week i was in vegas they had the computer system down twice .
great selection for inexpensive wigs .
the food was fantastic .
really attentive staff , incredible food !
did n't feel that clean or anything .
i will definitely dine here again when i return to vegas !
i have been a vegas regular for many years now .
old and ugly rooms .
check in line goes pretty quick but the actual process is slow .
is that how this problem is resolved ?
the casino seems dark , smokey , and old .
i stayed during labor day weekend the price was good .
this will be a regular visit every time we come to vegas .
that is the biggest bull crap i have ever heard .
definitely an interesting crowd depending on what you 're looking for .
she said i have to buy a empty cup for $ _num_ !
service is fabulous , people watching is fun when sitting in the cafe .
the sides of rice and beans were excellent .
i split it with my friend and she told me to finish it .
upon staying i realized more and more things wrong .
and they 're great about accommodating large groups .
this is not it .
they decided to charge me extra _num_ for gel polish .
customer service was quick and accurate !
the sangria is phenomenal and strong .
i 've loved hello kitty as long as i can remember .
tacos and enchiladas are great dinner choices .
we enjoyed ourselves immensely - the service was good too .
so i said no thanks .
you can taste the freshness and that 's exactly what i like .
one of the most pleasant experiences i 've had in a gun shop yet !
a great place to dine besides the strip !
he did n't check up on us to see how we were doing .
my last visit was exceptional .
our server was helpful and playful .
staff always friendly and even accommodate early check in for me .
way more fun than we even imagined .
overall , a terrible experience on day _num_ .
the one major perk of the excalibur is the location .
- shower only , no bathtub .
this place is a classic !
our entrees were also quite good .
i have never seen worse customer service .
overall , beautiful restaurant for a calm weekend lunch .
sad that they keep change server and change chef .
inventive , unique and wonderful .
worse than any hotel or motel i have ever been to !
one of my favorite places to eat .
i could 've left to get food and been back in that time !
but rest of my family did really enjoyed their food .
the food was very good .
we also shared the huge serving of paella .
i just switched the bags , i had n't opened it . ''
after reading yelp reviews i was hesitant and for good reason .
this place is run terribly avoid at all costs !
great ambiance , fabulous food , and their drinks are to die for .
waiters were very attentive to our large group and the food was very tasty .
i look forward to it !
i could do it and i 'm not even a professional .
consistently exceptional and worth a visit .
the staff is very friendly .
has no one heard of customer service ?
they do n't tell you that when you book the hotel .
would n't call another employee to help .
so sad as i love love me some fried okra .
very poor customer service at front counters and cleanliness .
the food here is very satisfying and the service is great as well .
the only decent thing was the sweet green tea .
fast easy and stress free way to travel the strip .
however , he knew what was going on and apologized for it .
shame on excalibur hotel/casino .
after some time , i decided to give this place another chance .
when my family and i was signing the lease i was very nervous !
stuffed dates awesome ... .
it is worth the wait in my opinion .
atmosphere is relaxing and entertaining .
luis was the perfect waiter , attentive and knowledgeable .
great atmosphere and food awsome selection of cocktails .
there was lots of energy and very pleasant atmosphere .
the dj there played great island music , as well .
this hotel is very outdated .
a year ago , i probably would have given harrah 's three stars .
thanks , but no thanks .
the go into _num_ room & it was dirty .
i mean seriously , this is a convention center .
we enjoyed another stellar meal at circo .
not my fault you do n't understand english .
get your act together chinese village !
kids _num_ and under ride free and they will enjoy the trip .
it was light , flavorful , and satisfying .
from the beginning , i was not impressed .
it takes _num_ weeks and then they will send those to me .
great clean newer suite with nice amenities .
this hotel was not is not recommended if you want to enjoy your vacation .
the staff is super friendly and helpful .
the hotel room was fairly clean , bed was comfy .
the partial view of the strip was nice .
it would n't shut ( again 25th floor ) .
both were the perfect ending to our evening .
still drooling just thinking about it .
there 's no mini bar or snack center in the room .
came in with _num_ min to spare at end of happy hour .
great location on the strip , but this place is otherwise pathetic .
it 's cheap and all , but damn so far away from things !
they did a good job with the decorating .
i ate it and left .
all the food was great , and reasonably priced !
such a gem off the strip ; this place is awesome !
the folks that work here are the best !
this is our favorite restaurant in las vegas !
the place inside is disgusting .
the cookies were ridiculously fresh and still warm from the oven .
sleep in bed , and stole the purse that was on the table .
ca n't smoke in the restaurant side .
the pool hours really need to be extended .
so again , i asked him to quote me the price .
( spa , gym , pool , wi-fi , etc ) .
it reminded me of a greyhound bus terminal .
and of course , their sangria goes with all of their dishes !
_num_ star : cheap cost of hotels , good location to venetian and bellagio .
the heels are the best .
however , when i review i feel like _num_ stars is the best ever .
i 'm sure we will not return .
best happy hour in vegas in my opinion .
their red sangria is so good !
our instructor , rob was great , fun and cool .
the girls are nice and sweet and not fake .
great food but the service while friendly was slow .
_num_ nights $ _num_ , not well spent .
thanks for ruining my first trip u o vegas .
but it was not on sale .
pricey , but worth it .
everything i had was ridiculously good .
nothing like taking the long way around when it 's _num_ outside .
it 's pretty expensive but worth going too .
fourth , the room was not clean .
i ca n't say enough about this restaurant .
long long check in lines .
there is no wifi !
mostly every visitor pays a visit for this walgreens .
the quality of alterations is n't great either .
great place to grab a good burrito !
probably one of the best restaurant experiences i 've ever had in my life .
umm , what normal philly steaks have ?
totally , totally recommended .
third , our food took _num_ minutes to show up .
a lot of food items were dried out like the potatoes .
this walgreens is pretty huge !
they really pay attention to detail here and i really enjoyed the experience !
at first i said ok thats too long but o well .
unfortunately , that shows how we feel we 've been treated throughout .
food cold , dry and no one attending the area .
they give you soap for the shower but no hand soap for the bathroom .
no , you do n't need one .
my issue is bed bugs .
checked in here to mardi gras tower .
and that leads me back to what i wrote above .
now it is the most bland disgusting watered down garbage ever .
absolutely the best makeup appointment i 've had .
damn , i wish i had one right now .
yummy yummy and perfect portions .
one for men , one for women !
$ _num_ for this !
the food is extremely over priced and it was not just bad but horrible .
romantic view , very nice & courteous server , & tasty food !
they had a variety and not all of them would break the bank .
but the main point is the food - and circo delivers .
i left , never to return .
- no free wifi !
- plumbing is loud and there was no hot water on sunday morning .
service is warm and professional and the wine list very comprehensive .
the place needs fixing in the visual sense and more structure in their organization .
the tv remote was missing but did n't call for that .
at that point he was just annoyed and said give us the bill .
it tasted phenomenal , and i could barely taste the liquor .
for $ _num_ a person for dinner so not worth it .
the room was large enough to accomodate the roll away without feeling cramped .
nice peeps and handy from the venetian .
most of the lights in your room will not work .
have never been to a place with that slow service .
buffet is good for $ _num_ .
i 've made that mistake once and i will never do it again .
jenny hooks it up !
shady business practice , but that 's vegas .
carlos , was great , helping us choose our tapas .
im renting a studio apt .
chuck makes the best mixes , make sure you ask for him .
our host originally agreed , a party of _num_ people , price fixed menu .
i 've stayed at _num_ star hotels that had better accommodations .
the food also came out pretty quickly .
she seemed like she hated her life .
i wish i could give excalibur no stars .
if you do n't like it then you are seriously insane !
the decor is awesome .
then there 's the smell .
_num_ calls over a week and i still dont have the right product .
my friend and i shared the halibut entree .
to sum up : mediocre , overpriced food , served by idiots .
i 'm wondering if polo towers getting a cut out of it .
overall , i wo n't be back .
this is a decent mexican restaurant with great staff and a relaxed environment .
i think i will stay elsewhere next time i am there .
my son in laws steak was overcooked and my daughters steak had no flavor .
great tapas and sangria !
came here for lunch and had an excellent sandwich .
pitchers of sangria always make the mood more festive .
not a very good place to find a nice restaurant or for shopping .
fresh flour tortillas , pork empanadas , with a fantastic red sauce .
hot room , not cleaned properly and just plain beat up .
i wish it had he option to put zero stars !
my friend and i came here for an early dinner .
they tried to sell me special oil change $ _num_ bucks .
however the staff itself was always friendly and courteous .
complaint filed with the taxi bureau .
if you 're going to pay their rates , go spend it somewhere else .
tuna tartar with sashimi was good , sea bass excellent .
the arcade is fun , but really crowded as to be expected .
great selections of food !
but you 've been taking my payment by phone this entire time .
this was worth every cent !
amazing staff with great service for as busy as this store is !
vegas here i come !
the food was okay but nothing special .
our bill came to $ _num_ without the _num_ % tip that we include .
the patrons and some of the staff just made me sad .
this is a really good pasta restaurant .
real mistake on my part .
many of the bikes had no tickets .
we were lucky enough to get a complimentary room upgrade which was nice .
we will not be staying here again .
i really love the food here .
anyhow i just wanted to express my extreme disappointment in this particular location .
because i certainly left with a bitter taste in my mouth .
rude bell hop that had a major attitude and was short with us .
this is one of my favorite places to gamble in vegas .
small plates make it fun to try a little of everything .
but the price is what draws everyone to this place .
i the appetizers are delicious as well , for a good price .
the food is very solid .
great place to stop for gelato while walking through the venetian .
the business is full of everything you can imagine and a lot more .
food and drinks were so delicious !
just my kind of humor .
everyone enjoyed their meals .
and prices are not too bad for vegas .
on day _num_ when i left still broken .
our room had some trash left in it from a guest before .
paid about _num_ dollars more than the same order in philly .
we absolutly loved this restaurant !
everything in this hotel looks outdated although it does look clean and well kept .
some of the figures were so life like it was creepy .
the spa was on of the worst ones i have ever attended .
the room 's bedding was about as nice as a motel _num_ 's .
it 's great before going out .
prepare to crawl over your bed partner at _num_ am to use the facility .
four stars because of it .
the two roller coasters were amazing and the kids loved the arcade .
my wife ordered her wings naked with no sauce .
cheap , old , dirty .
them rip u off like they did me smh ... .
do n't waste your time here .
we will definitely be back !
from the service to the sangria to the tapas , firefly does it right .
the room is straight up old , it has never been remodeled .
they let you sample as well before buying and the pistachio flavor is amazing !
would most definitely go back again !
great fruity island drinks !
if the machine is frozen then why would i want to spend anymore money .
if the machine is frozen then why would i want to spend anymore money .
no friendly staff and shitty management !
the service is wonderful and very attentive , definetly _num_ star service !
an amazing old fashioned , fantastic dinner , great view , excellent service .
then our waitress was friendly enough but not a good waitress .
i hear the food is amazing too .
there 's just one thing going for excalibur - it 's cheap .
we stayed here for four nights in a two bedroom suite .
if you have used these products , you know the impeccable quality .
she also gave no direction on how to get to the room .
but all smokey , older casino 's are all the same .
this is a great place to just grab a quick bite !
if i had to choose one favorite in las vegas this would be it !
the real problem later was the way i was treated by security .
my wife and i enjoyed the atmosphere and the food .
overall , this place could use a remodel .
love this place , food was amazing and service was great .
got tower one which i believe is the older of the _num_ towers .
incredible food at great value .
we came for lunch & were very impressed !
probably the best way to get around the strip .
maybe they were tired .
i 'm assuming they have the friday off for the labor day weekend .
i 'm assuming they have the friday off for the labor day weekend .
if you want to risk it , pay the lower price and stay here .
it was just weird .
the staff was friendly , the doctor was competent and knowledgeable .
had corn soup today that was the best i ever had in my life .
the resort fee was $ _num_ ( including tax ) for _num_ days .
service was 1st class .
he refused me again , so i requested the supervisor .
very nice food choices !
enchiladas and fajitas were fresh and delicious .
and harrah 's does not have wireless !
everything came out really quick , and the sangria was amazing .
it 's even better if i 'm staying at the venetian !
housekeeping folks ( most ) walk right by you without even a glance .
this place is horrible it looks nice but so not worth it .
price : locally they are very reasonably priced .
the drinks can be pretty strong depending what you get .
their bagels are the best in las vegas .
as lame as you might expect .
two dirty coffee cups are outside my door when i checked in .
we ordered the red sangria which we loved !
easily the best lox i 've had since i ca n't even remember when .
the reuben omelet is absolutely amazing !
waitress was fair , will not return .
i 'll trek across town for this mole again , for sure !
had a # _num_ philly w/ provolone and side of chili fries .
it was big enough to fit _num_ girls comfortably .
the rooms were very outdated .
the oysters were also excellent , as was the caprese salad .
this hotel has terrible customer service .
good food for a decent price .
this is a must do in vegas !
do n't waste your $ $ .
thanks again to the wait staff and the chef !
the sauce base was the most flavorful i have ever tasted .
i 'm a bit annoyed by the yelp rating on this place .
getting a drink while playing was n't always the fastest .
the rooms are clean and everything works well .
so got the money back , but what a lot of trouble .
best carbonara i 've ever had !
authentic , delicious , and above all affordable tapas off-strip in las vegas .
this place is absolutely amazing !
i do n't understand how the food owners continue to have this account .
passionate and experienced instructors .
hmm , that 's weird .
the worst place i 've experienced in vegas !
this casino is a bit tired for las vegas .
the food , the service , and the environment were all top notch .
so here 's where i absolutely could not stand the rest of our experience .
so i would give more like a _num_ stars .
really a beautiful plate .
i have not stayed here in years .
fantastic vibe , fantastic atmosphere ... got ta love the charm !
the room smelled like cigarettes , the blow dryer burned .
really liked this hotel .
no water in the room .
owners , staff and managers are trying hard .
if i could give this place a zero i would .
the chef is outstanding !
girl that answer apologized about it and she was sorry for him being unprofessional .
the blinds do n't keep the sun out .
it 's the perfect drink for the hot summer weather .
however , _num_ out of _num_ things the hem is starting to fall out .
our waitress was super nice .
okay , i might be biased because i stayed at a different hotel .
our server was very very friendly and attentive .
eh not a place i 'd suggest to a friend .
spago vegas is number one in our book !
the room has carpet from _num_ with wallpaper and furniture to match .
their sushi is great !
not so much for adults wanting to avoid kids .
friendly and patient staff .
great drinks , awesome mexican food , super friendly bar tender !
bummed we did not have a good experience .
the food was delicious for a casual restaurant and so were the margaritas .
harrah 's is actually kind of cool .
he was very informative and outgoing .
this was an amazing experience !
the food was also delicious .
ok if i could give this place _num_ stars , i would .
if you see a line , it is worth the wait .
took back lobster tail , took back husbands fish .
if there were 1/2 star options i would rate it a _num_ .
i absolutely love tapas and the food here was not bad at all .
i could n't argue the price was great .
the lady looked at us like we had _num_ heads .
i like it cold , i usually set the thermostat at _num_ .
but tacos do n't cost $ _num_ .
average food but great location !
well worth cost of $ _num_ .
_num_ minute wait for the next order of shrimp .
$ _num_ for a cheesesteak and a soda .
i would rather stay elsewhere next time .
cream cheese wontons were delicious as well .
room are nice enough but has a few big fails in my book .
nasty looking bathroom with cracked counters .
rooms are also not very good .
excellent food , not too expensive .
this course is not maintained at all .
the food and drinks here at the paradise location is terrific !
my repeated request for this information was ignored .
to top it all off , the service was great .
the bartender seemed annoyed even though the bar was full .
thanks yelpers for the great recommendation !
i 'd say the two hostesses were quite rude if you ask me .
the service was great .
the service was great .
the service was great .
the service was great .
it 's a slice of heaven in sin city !
the thai beef salad tasted boring .
pro : food , decoration , service are all great !
i will probably not go back to the excalibur based on this .
as for dessert , we ordered key lime , light yet satisfying .
we just did this for our anniversary and our was the perfect date .
the rooms smelt like smoke even though it was a non-smoking room .
i ate one of them and refused to try another they were so bad .
they were nice and efficient and the bagels were nice and chewy .
that moment was _num_ minutes later .
i never use any of the so called amenities that this resort fee covers .
nothing like that ever happened .
worth the trip off the strip .
after it was sent back , it came back still kicking around .
the price is right and the location is great !
it 's dark , you ca n't see anything .
she knew exactly what i wanted and did it to perfection .
i do n't recommend going to this place at all .
the office staff is so rude and lazy .
i highly recommend discount firearms .
the bagels are great .
i just loved it .
never will go back ... go to another place .
at 4pm this would be annoying , but at 10pm this is unacceptable .
the stromboli is disgusting .
the problem started when we checked in .
the sangria was okay but not great .
lol , humor does go a long way .
is n't it your responsibility to greet the customers first ?
this place is cheap .
it 's right in the middle of the strip .
the staff made things worst .
good drink prices even if its not happy hour .
the rooms are unimpressive and the atmosphere was ehh .
they do n't take no for an answer .
no compensation or discounts , nothing .
the staff is pleasant and efficient .
overall , just a bad experience .
the staff are helpful and friendly .
i wo n't be going there again .
i loved walking through this museum and seeing all the stars .
learned to play craps - fun , challenging game .
he made the experience more exciting and more fun .
great beet salad and just an al around good time .
it was very hard to sleep !
the hotel does not have wifi access .
they were both delicious , well-prepared and beautifully displayed .
always tasty entrees and creative desserts .
i enjoyed the ambience , service and most importantly , the italian food .
the job she did was outstanding .
to my relief , these bagels were delicious !
there are twists and turns and wide hallways to accommodate the vegas sized crowds .
when we get up there was n't as clean as it should of been .
i 've only had the sushi ... but it was great !
my favorite store at the premium outlet mall .
refund some of the money i spent and maybe i will accept it .
the hotel lobby stinks .
the room was dirty and obviously somebody had been smoking in the room .
i 'm in vegas every few months and this is a spot i frequent .
instead i listened to how other doctors did not do their job correctly .
stayed here for nye and had a decent experience .
never have i gone through anything like this .
the concierge desk was a little rude .
the ribeye was less than great quality .
my favorite were the dates and the chocolate cake .
i will definitely be returning .
the weekend rates were super cheap .
i was not that impressed .
definitely a splurge , but well worth it for a lovely evening .
the portion is huge !
old school italian at it 's pretty much best .
i came in here once with my girlfriend ... .
pretty good place to eat , perfect spot for people watching .
then towards the end i asked for the check and a togo box .
there are so many great things to say .
the pork is incredibly tender and everything is well flavored .
had a great time here !
they have a sushi bar , steamed pork buns and perfect food .
i settled on a black piece with blue and silver hands .
the food is amazing at take out prices .
a place to get relaxed with friends enjoying nice food .
not to mention the indian lady there was so rude also !
it seems like a management issue .
they have great food and a lot of interesting and fun cocktails .
drinks are always amazing .
i love this place so much .
i would not recommend and seek alternatives if at all possible .
they have excellent breakfast too .
plus they are so limited .
my first thing , check the bed for bugs or anything weird .
get new keys , go back up , same problem .
bacon wrapped dates , savory chicken skewers and a delicious even cooked calamari .
excellent food and great service .
guy fieri needs a slap in the face !
and i could n't figure out how to shut it off !
but you can get a room for $ _num_ sometimes !
only offered one show and that was the tournament of kings .
you 're probably better off getting a microwave dinner .
nice way to start off your vegas trip .
the bartenders there are always entertaining .
the `` human sculptures '' are interesting .
absolutely want to go back and try something else .
the wait staff was perfect .
the service was fantastic and so was the food .
one of my favorite happy hours in town .
i 've ordered on separate occasions and have been really impressed with the results .
it 's one of the best restaurants in town .
he made our experience extra special tonight .
keep up the exceptional service guys !
great food and great service !
it was the perfect dish for a tasty but light lunch .
so forget them and the horse they rode in on .
it 's kind of expensive on certain prizes , but worth it on others .
dont think we 'll be ordering from here again .
ok -- - fat tuesday = not a bar .
this place is terrible .
this place is terrible .
this place is terrible .
the deposit was to be refunded if not used .
i advise to find another carwash .
the service was very fast and friendly .
best food since we have been in vegas .
solid italian food ; great for groups and business gatherings .
this place is always packed so i recommend making a reservation .
old tv that i could not make work .
there 's lots of locations on the strip so you can refill anywhere !
worse then a car dealership .
there is a smell that i can not stand .
the flight seemed too short but each of us got to float _num_ times .
this is just unbelievable .
that 's just dirt cheap for vegas .
a great place for cheap weekend brunch .
shrimp tempura tasted terrible .
love their dessert donuts !
one of the clean , young casinos with $ _num_ tables .
they are the best .
everyone knows how bad this hotel is so i have nothing more to say .
it was not crowded .
horrible place to stay !
noisy to the point of nearly ruining our dining experience .
the coupon is great for refills !
great atmosphere , great food , great service .
no attitudes here and the prices are very good too .
we came for breakfast and loved it .
cheap hotel do n't expect much .
the only good thing about this location is the location .
i was able to make one and it was with rachel .
you ca n't judge him , you do n't even know him .
it is a quiet locale .
best mexican restaurant on the east side !
really , they need to upgrade their rooms with 21st century amenities .
the ultimate pina colada is delicious but low on the alcohol content .
dine in food is also excellent .
good luck climbing it !
never again will i step a foot into this place again .
as always , an excellent world of shoes and service .
i was in tower _num_ .
why would anyone want to play here ?
the first casino that i entered when i was a kid .
i stopped by for lunch here and it was pretty good .
in this case , `` food '' however is a stretch .
the staff was friendly and the atmosphere is great .
here is the big problem .
i 'd suggest going somewhere else , though .
the service is quick but helpful .
check in took over an hour , with only _num_ people work .
is wifi so important ?
the doors for the rooms are around an inch off the floor .
i wish them all my best !
such a great shopping experience .
do n't waist your time with this office , find a different one .
the place is ridiculously dirty .
she was not say any word about the wrong order .
do n't be a cheap ass .
brought a party of _num_ people there last night .
i really did n't enjoy our stay at the excalibur .
thank you for accommodating me , circo !
assortment of breads was nice .
i love you fat tuesday !
this is probably the worst hotel i 've ever stayed at on the strip .
i loved the pitchers of mojitos and sangria .
i 'm making this _num_ stars so everyone can see this !
i am just tired .
i will never ever spend that much money for alright steak with terrible service .
no wonder this place is such a **** hole .
it is what it is .
loved the restaurant ambience and food .
the pasta is wonderful .
thank you for your beautiful arrangements !
i recommend this area of the strip and harrah 's is a fun area .
it had _num_ % prices on sushi and it was delicious !
this place is only good if you have that seafood craving .
i gave _num_ star just because it is a fancy restaurant above palms casino .
very diverse crowd , everyone having fun and enjoying the food and music .
next time i visit vegas .
the toilet ran all night ( very loud ) .
sorry , i do not recommend this hotel .
i would also not use their on-line deals .
cause at this point i 'll do anything to get you out of here .
salads were bland and tasteless .
ensuring the best quality of service !
yes it 's cheap but that 's because it sucks .
large space , clean & well kept .
we will highly recommend this company to all !
the person taking our order did not seem to thrilled to be serving us .
first time at this location and my favorite burger was _num_ % ruined .
the arcade 's hours are the worst .
i had a great margarita , coconut shrimp & salad ( lunch special ) .
and thankfully that 's all we gave our server for the experience .
everyone was nice and i was very happy with the super friendly customer service .
the pool was freezing cold .
recommended to come back again !
west tower room is nice and clean .
only thing i liked was the mashed potatoes .
i had the most delicious chocolate shake made for me here .
( no room service after _num_ for a family friendly hotel ? )
i would recommend ... ... ... ... ... .
also , there are no coffee pots in the rooms !
it 's not too clean .
he then offered to try and clean the shirt .
the best and freshest food i 've ever had !
she returned _num_ minutes later and asked one question .
the portion size was large ( she was unable to finish ) .
no one even turned around to see if she was okay .
as many of you know , tips get your favorite songs played faster .
this has to be the worst hotel i have stayed at .
give it a go !
thanks a million , maureen !
please do not waste your time coming here for glasses .
i stayed out to gambling all night rather than sleeping in the room .
he would n't take it .
they have _num_ locations ... this one is on eastern ave .
if it 's free , i would n't mind .
for vegas , it is surprisingly dated convention center .
great , flavorful tapas .
went for lunch and it was great .
fridge did n't work until the next day and got that comp 'd too .
the firefly fries are always a hit when we bring people here .
i prefer the planet hollywood and mgm locations .
so in short - we got a great value .
the food and service was fantastic like always .
i 'm so glad i never have to see them again .
i was disappointed and disgusted .
we recently had dinner here as a party of _num_ .
love the product they produce as well as the friendliness .
nice people work here .
overall , it was a nightmare and i left with a horrible headache .
this place was absolutely delicious !
this place was absolutely delicious !
wo n't be going back to this location .
gucci this , gucci that !
i hate writing crappy reviews .
employees seem like they hate working here .
she honestly ruined my entire experience at this hotel .
the least expensive bottle of wine was the house wine at $ _num_ .
also their gel products are cheap .
i actually enjoyed it !
my family and i stopped here on a whim during our vacation .
the sushi chef had already closed up everything .
sat down with my boyfriend and a friend at the electronic roulette table .
interest varies but the principle price should not .
check-in was a disaster .
we will definitely be going back !
just trying to make you look at the stuff .
thanks for the excellent end to the vacation .
next , i leave the office .
service was very good as well .
and it is a prime location , too .
they have _num_ people at every entrance !
awesome job by all .
vegas has very little to choose from when it comes to mall shopping .
it was basically falling apart and most of the games were awful .
if they want repeat business at the hotel , they did n't show it .
the chef is spectacular !
holly mother of all that is awesome this place is great !
so i just decided to rent out a room at excalibur .
_num_ octane with an extra shot of _num_ all day !
the prices here are really reasonable too !
they also have games at the second floor where kids can stay at .
everything is so real feeling .
certainly not with all that grease .
i mean black and dirty on the cushions , arms and back .
eat light before you drink these !
even the bread they give you at the start is awesome .
also no apparent free parking anymore .
what a sad , tired , shit hole this place is .
it 's great fun for all ages .
also , waiting in line _num_ minutes for a cup of coffee seems excessive .
overall the best place for bagels and lox or rate pastrami sandwich .
no wonder it has only _num_ starts not surprised .
the staff is very polite and helpful .
nothing crazy that makes me want to stick around .
food was delicious including appetizers , entrees and margaritas .
this is vegas , they 're everywhere !
the seating areas are for customers . ''
bathroom was horrible and dingy looking .
the manger and owner guy stated it was my fault .
you will have a authentic local experience here .
the staff was friendly and helpful .
the food is always good .
though i feel like i could have flown all day , two was great !
i do n't even like walking through the casino .
when we were done our bill was $ _num_ for my husband and i .
they have a few package deals that are pretty good for the beginner .
i 'm super annoyed , hot and frustrated .
my husband , two friends and i went for their all you can eat .
definitely recommended to any nike lovers out there visiting vegas !
this made my day alot better .
vegas buffets are my favorite and this one was cheap yes , but delicious ?
the sangria was pretty good too !
if the following did not happen , _num_ stars .
i had my wedding reception here a few weeks ago .
had a great lunch today !
we will not be back .
would i like to complain ?
the management got so embarrassed off her actions she left the building .
on top of that the staff is horrible .
apparently you folks are not so consistent from location to location .
so there were partially raw onions in the mix .
avoid this store at all costs !
we stayed _num_ night in _num_ rooms in tower _num_ .
service was first rate .
he said it was to make up for my bad experience .
i spoke to the hostesses and they were very friendly .
i will never step foot there again .
for what its worse : they said car break ins happen regularly .
motel _num_ has wifi .
tapas and sangria ... yes please !
this show was so fake and so obvious about it .
worst experience ever coming to this doctor .
good food good drinks good service .
we had a really good experience .
they are the worst here !
the atmosphere is nice .
the decor was very clean and modern .
it 's crowded , dark , and festive .
definitely worth it , beats walking in the horrific heat .
i really loved the people .
super personable and great service !
casinos are too much fun !
im done with pep boys as is my boyfriend .
the clothing closet has no doors on it .
this was my 6th or 7th visit in _num_ years .
it is absolutely awful , it smells like stale cigarette smoke and must .
tenderloin was superb , as was the tuna .
the hotel is fine .
happy hour is amazing !
i would be very happy to visit here again .
i 've ordered here twice and both times the food was horrible .
i officially love this place !
it was clean , machines were plentiful and well-maintained .
there is a reason why they are never that busy .
became a time share owner about _num_ years ago , what a big mistake !
our servers were gracious and efficient .
the room service is only until _num_ p.m .
i paid _num_ bucks through the app to buy the room .
the scary part was entirely closed .
after waiting _num_ minutes .
great location without the overpriced rates .
a great bottle of cabernet .
circus circus is absolutely worth the price !
the pitchers of margaritas are generous .
this facility is pretty clean however the parking not so cool .
but they are not .
the food was really good too .
what happened , conditions have been getting worse here .
if i 'm at work , i can not answer your call .
there are more updated rooms that were available but appears for a little more .
the food is delicious and the prices are really reasonable .
really enjoyed the experience !
my travel companions were equally disappointed .
this is the review of the restaurant week _num_ prix fixe menu .
lots of seating and a good size parking lot .
each of these items is fantastic !
i ordered a beef and cheese sandwich , which was forgettable .
very bland & dreadful food .
those churros are the best churros i 've ever had .
they simply were n't very good .
they refused to replace it , even though it was making my kids sick .
and yet they did such a lousy job .
those beds are so hard it 's like sleeping on the ground !
not a good start .
we actually bought a whole bottle of cake vodka from the manager there .
on the upside , the blackjack dealers were great .
two trips to the front desk , and no results .
came back to the room to rest , and the tv does not work .
there is n't an employee at the game .
the halibut special was also delicious .
i got steak and veggies both were very good .
the white sangria was also delicious with lots of fresh fruit .
i choose not to go to this mall because of it 's boring stores .
the rooms here are dingy and outdated .
the jello shots contain zero alcohol .
the pictures for this hotel were very misleading .
very delicious meal and great serving size .
drinks are excellent too !
one of my favorite places to go in lv !
i went here a couple of years ago with a friend in town visiting .
so disgusting to live and sleep in a room that reeks of stale smoke .
steve is not a hairdresser , surely he ca n't be .
total times spent : _num_ minutes to pickup _num_ toys .
so play and have fun !
this hotel is such a great deal for its price .
felt great after that drink .
so id give it four stars .
i absolutely love firefly .
he told me that i overcooked it .
the best lamb chops ever .
the day before they cleaned our room , but not today .
the shower never completely stopped running during my entire visit .
amazing service , decor and italian pasta !
the menu is pretty decent , has a few options .
if you go , ask for a recently renovated room if there is one .
from the moment we walked in the front door , i was terrified .
the service was attentive and friendly .
the dishes were very well seasoned and in good portions .
loved it definitely will go again soon !
now i get home check my receipt and nothing was refunded .
good food and a great price !
loved the fajitas , shrimp burrito and the tacos .
and classic chopped salad .
it can get packed and that carnival thing outside is loud !
the server only brought after we asked for it .
the service was impeccable .
it was all very good .
i 'm not sure why i 've tried these guys more than once .
and the lady serving us was so nice .
definitely worth trying if you 're visiting the area .
what a wonderful restaurant .
they make a pretty good mojito .
overall , the hotel is not that great and the service is poor .
but the food was really good !
dave was our guy and he was super nice and funny .
so hopefully you find your things before you return home .
next thing we know , our door room is open .
the ambiance was delightful and the service was excellent .
all the dishes were very flavorful !
the staff is super helpful and all the food and drinks are amazing .
chef eric came out and spoke with us and checked on us between courses .
there was no sign saying there was a safe in the room .
she is so knowledgeable in her profession and has a great bubbly personality .
there was no wifi and there was n't a channel guide for the tv .
the line is really long but for a really good reason .
its so annoying they will talk forever even after you say no .
also this place has an adventure dome which you can go on amusement rides .
been telling friends & family for years about this fun place !
stayed here in october _num_ with my best friend for her birthday .
so call them they ca n't do nothing until the next day .
this place makes me happy .
such a nasty attitude .
this place is a lot of fun !
the manager and ben were so fun !
thank you for such an absolutely amazing job !
love love the food here !
however , the fact that i no longer accept free rooms here says something .
the chicken philly was over priced and under seasoned .
though they are mostly friendly , this is just silly .
i swear to god , i tried almost every .
i didnt see anything that was gross or dirty .
extremely reasonable prices and great options .
she did n't listen very well.
we always brought friends and family here when they came to visit !
check out early because did not feels safe in the hotel another day .
my first time meeting someone famous ... well , sorta .
did not utilize fitness or spa .
great price , yummy drinks ... awesome test tube shots sticking out !
will definitely stay there again .
both were excellent in service and quality .
they were very nice and i would highly recommend .
they have the worst customer service i have ever seen .
overall : spago offers a great lunch and is definitely worth visiting .
the better tapas were completely forgettable , the rest were actually bad .
not new tires i have a new car .
worst apartment complex and management i 've ever dealt with .
the lady was just rude .
the sink was clogged even after maintenance worked on it for _num_ minutes .
but i must compliment them on their service .
i hotel hopped several hotels and this was low on the list .
the quality of fish really suffered .
i 'm thinking omg this is discussing .
needs renovations ... i definitely will not pay to stay here .
this place is great clean beds and all different kinds !
the desserts here are amazing and the service was n't bad .
great drinks , ambiance , and the food is outstanding !
and whatever does , i do n't want to know .
i went to a time share presentation here just for the gifts .
they are all professional .
*the music and service was above average .
it was burned very bad on the bottom , very weird and gross .
checkin was quick and easy , the attendant was nice !
anywho , the rating is just for the entire first experience .
i loved the bacon wrapped dates and the caramel flan the best !
this is one of the best ( somewhat ) hidden gems in las vegas .
our server randy was great .
i do n't know why this location makes things so difficult .
our server was hostile .
it is an expensive restaurant , but it is worth what it costs !
this is one of the best pizza in town .
i recommend coming here for happy hour !
guess i 'm easily impressed !
but with all the great restaurants in vegas there are better options .
lastly the restaurant was noisy .
it was all overcooked and brown .
a great restaurant for old school food , decor and service .
for some reason , they shredded the scallops .
the door locks need serious maintenance .
i 've had hot pockets that tasted better .
ca n't believe they are charging parking now .
pretty bad experience with this hotel .
they could n't be bothered to fake a smile !
the staff is extremely friendly .
they 're borderline disrespectful on this .
also free towels and _num_ grills if you want to cook .
extremely disappointed in this hotel at every turn .
also , the shower in our room was broken .
great food , friendly people .
this place is wonderful !
they have excellent red and white sangria and tapas .
really poor compared to the place around the corner but the same price .
the casino was subpar and reeked of stale smoke .
i especially liked their cranberry walnut bread .
they have an extensive menu with a lot of great choices .
she was quick , efficient and very friendly .
my new favorite game is let it ride with the _num_ card bonus .
the manager says , `` well , have you already eaten ?
good stuff if you are trying to shake that hangover .
everytime someone goes to the bathroom or shower ... ... .
i work at the mall also , so i know customer service is priority .
new york style bagels .
i guess our waitress sucked ass , big time .
i was disappointed that there were n't more wax figures .
this is a great place for lunch .
$ _num_ a night with resort fee .
but that is not the biggest problem .
the mahi we ordered was okay but so dry it was inedible .
its loud , dark and sexy .
this bartender really had a bad vibe .
never got refills on our drinks , so we sat there with empty glasses .
really great for families too .
the mushroom pizza is amazing .
the chardonnay for the appetizer was light and yummy .
not my favorite restaurant in vegas , my favorite restaurant period !
the staff were truly amazing !
and i got almost zero reception for my cell phone .
this place has gone downhill .
the food is awesome , and so are the drinks .
you can even add one extra shot of alcohol for only $ _num_ !
employees are super friendly and responsive .
after leaving i thought i could not come back to stay here unless free .
have any of you actually had a stromboli before ?
waited _num_ min for a shoe size .
the instructor was awesome and so great with everyone .
then my room was n't ready for another two hours .
plus the eggs had runny whites and i ordered them over med .
great guac too : ) ) .
great service , friendly owner 's and a nice clean laundromat .
bad food , bad service , bad location .
too tough and fatty .
makes it very convenient !
fresh veggies , meats and sauce all nearly perfectly balanced .
no crowd , little wait , quick service .
i hate coming here .
one bowl of soup from their food court was $ _num_ .
this hotel is no place for a good family .
the decor is very outdated and dingy , they need a whole update !
however , i wo n't be back .
the tres leches was a great way to end a fantastic meal .
the food was great and the place has a nice atmosphere .
what the hell is that .
if you are looking for fast friendly efficient service , look elsewhere .
the food is fantastic !
to be honest , the prices are n't even that great .
it was the worst mistake ever ... .
should 've gone zero .
staff : not helpful and not friendly .
worst customers service ever .
poor explanation of sushi and ice cream .
this place has delish tapas !
worth a second run .
please sir , can i have some more ?
the food is delicious , but the portions are tight .
so nice of you to offer !
i stayed here last week for _num_ nights and quite frankly it sucked .
_num_ minutes passed buy _num_ more employees did the same thing .
they want your money .
a half hour later , no one had come .
let me tell you that it 's not worth the trouble .
great fun , & great food .
so i made it a point to stop by .
always crowded , but so fun .
service was prompt , friendly and helpful .
thank you once again for making my family spring break getaway a success !
they also have some great comedy shows .
this place is the complete opposite .
sangria , tapas , paella !
pool closes before _num_ pm .
not to mention the best rooms !
their firecracker shrimp and shrimp & lobster quesadillas are amazing !
we were very happy with the staff there .
i have left several messages but have not been called back .
i 'm never seen such a fine variety of the high-end athletic gear .
not off to a great start .
it all came together , we were robbed in our own hotel room .
if not , they need a new one .
the people at the front desk are rude and incompetent .
at this price point , the luxor is a much better deal .
he 's also really nice .
our instructor did a wonderful job and was patient .
i love harrah 's !
the rooms are clean and the staff is very friendly .
i highly recommend this location !
everything we had was good , but a bit heavy though .
i believe they have a yelp checkin discount which probably gave them more stars .
it 's a clean , efficient source of transportation .
see my last review , every bit of it still holds but one update .
excellent meal and service .
i booked a room at the excalibur for my friends and me .
she needs a reality check and a slice of humble pie .
a fine , and classy way to end dinner .
carpets in the hallways were completely dirty and stained .
i booked a reservation online for $ _num_ ( december _num_ ) .
the line is annoying to pass on the way to real bars .
i would highly recommend this place to anyone .
i just happened to get it the worst !
smaller and bigger sizes are vary too .
he was excited , thinking that we were staying in a castle .
christine always does my nails and she 's a perfectionist .
everything was enjoyable and had much flavor .
this is not sushi .
my wife loved the chicken fajitas .
the service was exceptional and we will come back on our next trip .
people all up in bins digging for stuff they do n't really need .
two drinks in a confusing fashion were delivered .
my meatloaf was delicious .
entering the non smoking room , it smelled like smoke .
lindsey did an excellent job .
i dont think i ask for anything too much .
this store offers a nice selection of very elegant and cute clothing .
comfortable beds , and lots of room for you to get ready .
the buffet is just o.k .
highly recommended for your trip to vegas .
overall , good value for the price .
been here for half an hour and already pissed off .
i could not remove it myself , so i asked for help .
this is a great resource .
the food is excellent , place is very nice and staff was very good .
never again will i step foot in this ridiculous place .
the shrimp linguine was delicious , and my sister said her fish was too .
too expensive i asked ?
server frank was terrific .
have always received exceptional service .
ok , we love it !
enjoyed beef tartare and filet enter .
i am not even kidding .
the whole hotel smelled awful .
guess that 's partially my fault .
seriously the fastest er visit and best overnight hospital stay !
the er staff very friendly and helpful .
the casino was pretty good and you could get drinks without waiting too long .
he was informative , kind , and attentive .
i am totally unsatisfied with this store .
i am totally unsatisfied with this store .
food and service was great !
the service & food are always prepared to perfection .
she is far and away the best thing about this property .
hopefully our paths will cross again elsewhere .
the service was unmatched - just perfect .
but i really just wanted the biscuits and lobster nachos .
during my stay here i 've been quite disappointed .
valet : cordial , but did not look clean .
not to mention the two guys working were miserable .
the stuffed dates are really good !
very clean and comfortable with a beautiful view of some of the strip .
we got a personalized trip catered to our needs .
old school vegas that has incredible bagels .
not a great location , rooms are small and guaranteed to smell bad .
they also can use a better bbq sauce for it .
my family and i will definitely be returning to this restaurant in the future .
i tried a piece of their pizza which was excellent as well .
delicious food , excellent service , prices were reasonable and portions were excellent .
came here this past weekend and stayed at harrahs .
the furniture and look of the rooms are very outdated .
so far , this place is awesome !
$ _num_ to have two pairs of dress pants taken in .
the prices are a bit high , but the food is worth the price .
our waiter was not pleased to have our table of _num_ .
awesome service at dinner .
unfortunately , he was worse than her .
great care again in both the er and pediatric ward .
i got the bacon and swiss cheese steak .
all entrees were delicious especially the mongolian beef .
the sangria and mojitos were awesome as well !
but they sure ask a lot of money for the view .
the sushi rice tasted very sour like it was a few days old .
we were put in tower one which is the worst .
i gave this hotel _num_ stars .
the best italian food !
it took another _num_ minutes for me to find someone to pay the bill .
oops , i forgot , airlines no longer serve food .
the manager did n't want to work with my daughter and i .
the environment is so awesome and this place is so much fun .
i stayed on saturday june 4th .
really , it should get _num_ 1/4 stars .
our table had an assortment of food and all was great .
a waste of my time .
would recommend for a nice mexican food night out !
i did not like how the pictures came out at all .
but overall very caring and competent .
did n't touch the rear tire or front grill .
the staff is always friendly and there is plenty of seating .
i took a chance and it paid off , my bouquet was gorgeous .
flavor is way above average .
ron is a really honest and professional auto repair specialist .
fantastically priced and portioned .
imo , this location is n't so great .
this place is a classic , and the food is excellent .
but like the boulevard mall , the years have not been kind to it .
the staff are friendly , nice and helpful .
i was so frustrated with this hotel and casino .
the atmosphere was cool and very red , and the food was delicious !
this place has delicious tapas .
amazing place for kids and adults !
the mani itself was really good quality as well .
sure , it 's cheap .
love to shop at this place , great customer service and quality stuff !
if you see this review , never eat at this horrible place .
it was great years ago and still is .
for that alone i love this place .
while broke in college , this was the cheapest hotel we could get .
spent over $ _num_ a night on the room , not worth it .
other than that , the rooms are ok , but no fridge !
i have made a point to avoid this place since .
he was rude to my mother at check out .
if you want a good experience and great prices go here .
does n't deserve a star at all !
i took _num_ bites and threw it away .
when the bell boy arrived he was in a bad mood .
the room showed online is not the room you 'll get .
i 'm here for a couple weeks for work and they have been great .
first off it was advertised with free internet , not .
no hot water the first night , said they were working on it .
having said that , i would not visit this restaurant again .
really good prices and the employees were very helpful and friendly .
_num_ chicken cheese chorizo mushrooms were amazing as well .
awesome food , excellent customer service .
had an awesome time for a decent price .
the food they do offer is very bland , and simply below average .
yum and strong at the same time .
one of the best bday dinners ever !
so happy with my experience here .
this is a gem in the venetian .
wolfgang 's restaraunt is great !
celebrity treatment and phenomenal skills will not leave you disappointed .
really enjoy coming here for breakfast !
this place sucks and it 's unfortunate when guests have no choice really .
they will give you excuses any chance they get .
the casino also rocks .
do they have to have a price fixed menu too ? ''
after that long of a wait i was n't sending it back .
spago has really unique and delicious appetizers .
we have always liked it and found really nice stay for us .
it did not live up to the hype and expectations .
i dont recommend this place plus the service is horrible .
sister had the habanero wings and the jerk shrimp , very good !
sunrise takes great care of our family !
fortunately , everything turned out really well .
it 's like they might as well not even exist .
only two locations remain they are in new mexico and washington .
my son and i absolutely loved him !
i ordered everything by phone and the lady who helped me was wonderful .
i absolutely love fat tuesday !
this place is soooo off and on to me .
the pork carnitas burrito is excellent .
i 'm will definitely not be spending my money here , ever again .
i did n't want to put him through that again on another day .
probably my new favorite store of this kind .
i hated this place the whole time i was here .
we got super lucky and got james as our waiter again !
their chopped vegetable salad is amazing .
very fresh and unique ingredients .
then the next thing you know , they called the security over .
then the next thing you know , they called the security over .
_num_ hours has passed and still no call .
had the best meatloaf of my life at this place .
the ac worked but it was old and made a lot of noise .
great place to go w friends for drinks and quality food .
the wait staff was excellent and attentive with great knowledge of the menu .
what a great time .
he then walked around for the next _num_ hours by himself .
he was helpful , amusing , and very thorough in his training .
the lack of flavor made me wish i had kept going .
serious gives me an instant headache .
our first night there was absolutely terrible .
they do n't even have a coffee maker .
so i just decide to take them .
now the taste was n't great , the avocado does n't taste fresh .
brett was our instructor and he made our entire experience awesome !
the best coconut shrimp wish the had one in ca .
worse than that , they were still there when i checked out .
we left and went to starbucks , where the counter woman was delightful !
it was a spring break weekend and the place was packed .
did not know i would be staying at a time share .
shrimp ceviche / tuna tartare were also very good .
this is a horrible run business .
a polite no with an explanation why would suffice .
great rates on a low budget makes this hotel a perfect pick !
had a great stay at the hotel .
we will be coming back for that great guest service !
many people do not know that harrah 's used to be a holiday inn .
problem _num_ , risk management .
if you are ever in need of an obgyn , this is the place !
came here last year and todd and john were spectacular .
when in vegas , check it out !
yeah , this place just does n't seem very clean to me .
our waiter was great - extremely attentive .
for a decent price , i got fairly buzzed off the margaritas .
always a must when we come to vegas from la .
amazingly , no one bothered us .
they prepare their food with love .
the smell is that of a _num_ year old ash tray .
when we got there , it was empty .
this was incredibly annoying .
they are honest , helpful , fast , and reasonably priced .
we had a great time !
false advertising and i was extremely disappointed .
i tried the $ _num_ trick and it did not work !
i had a chorizo dip that was wonderful and light .
just avoid this location if you can .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
sadly , excalibur scores _num_ for _num_ on this measure .
right near the center of the strip with its own monorail stop .
very very disappointing to say the least .
the whole room was pretty dirty especially the whole bathroom .
not enough for us to be back though .
best wig store ever .
the manager could not handle the situation .
they charge _num_ % for parties of _num_ or more , dinner is _num_ .
but , since i was there for work i really enjoyed this hotel .
the selection is fresh , healthy and creative .
mexican food with a twist .
okay ... all i have to say is that i got special treatment .
the guac is delicious and i reccomend the carnitas and carne asada .
_num_ of us in our group and everyone was delighted !
good food and good service .
this is my favorite restaurant in vegas !
this is not what i call sushi .
i love going to vegas !
this experience , however , was not .
not to mention , the chocolate sauce was n't rich enough .
after traveling for _num_ hours , this was not music to our ears .
fantastic customer service and excellent attention to details .
its like a motel _num_ on top of a casino .
fantastic food , very reasonably priced .
simply amazing from service to plate .
none of the other casino 's seemed to have this problem .
the hotel has not internet .
calling at all times of the day , on every day of the week .
my pasta bolognese was super tasty .
either that 's not true or they upgraded with cheap material .
great for families to be .
found the food to be quite good , the service fast and accommodating .
once again , it was huge & really good ; highly recommend !
unfortunately , our stay did not end on a pleasant note .
the breakfast has waffles , eggs , potatoes , juices , yogurt , etc .
service was excellent , and great people watching !
soooo not coming back !
the bed was ok for me , but uncomfortable for my wife .
good place to spend some extra cash .
but it 's a sad , tired , shit hole nevertheless .
wo n't be going back , which is a shame .
everything is really nice and updated and picture perfect albeit a little small .
great place in vegas to grab a quick tan !
god only knows what kind of fluids left those stains !
this one was a pleasant surprise .
what a great place !
i would highly recommend staying here !
then , they hire a bunch of security guards to guide traffic .
and the selection of gear and shoes is good .
my whole family rocks nike , and nike town is where we go .
it was so dry and did not have any flavor at all .
the dealers we had were just awful , we were at the blackjack table .
i 'm from chicago and we use real cheese !
this place used to be one of my favorite malls .
it 's a very popular spot for the locals .
paying guests should have a place to park , no matter what .
but it was still a little uncomfortable and we felt rushed .
i really enjoy this place .
wonderful service and a fun experience .
i enjoy people who take their job seriously .
its a fun spot !
do n't stay here .
today i was disappointed to the server .
the folks here were really nice and knowledgeable .
horrible is an understatement !
last , and certainly not least , they lack wifi .
my pastrami rueben was fantastic .
, the tuna tartare was amazing !
the driver was very friendly and able to discuss guns at length .
security never smiles and it seems like everyone is drunk .
we get on the shuttle only to find it charges _num_ a head .
sorry guys but after this our accounts will be canceled .
i understand that it was cheap and old but it was absolutely disgusting .
retro menu and prices to match .
one of my favorites in vegas .
it took over _num_ hours to fix my car .
probably the most fun thing i 've done since moving here .
room _num_ : rude front desk managers .
i 'm not gon na even waste my time with them anymore .
hotel gets very crowded and there is not much walking space .
much better than the other places i hit up for lunch .
this place is a landmark of vegas but it needs some major improvements .
there was no bed bugs and the bathroom was big .
the room was well stocked , clean , and came with complementary wifi .
the carpets are dirty and grimy and the `` stores '' are lacking .
great photos and all around phenomenal place !
thankfully it 's only noon and i got my hubby by my side !
will definitely be going back .
a memorable experience that will surely last a lifetime .
the rooms are small and the walls are sooooooo thin .
i highly recommend the beef rib .
they did n't want to serve us and made it very clear .
i was n't expecting much from ratings , but i was quite surprised .
i will update this review if i ever get an appointment .
the price the quality of the food and everything else is just terrific .
my food was good and the service was very good .
i recommend it for sure !
your housekeeping staff simply forgot us .
we will definitely be coming back !
but i still come here pretty often .
i 'm so glad i found this starbucks .
friendly staff and quick turnover at the lines .
wo n't be going back anytime soon .
i stopped in with some friends , and we are an odd group .
the location is perfect !
however nobody informed my parents .
he was very rude and even said `` welcome to big business ! ''
they 're much nicer over there plus they care about how their store looks .
the bacon wrapped dates are awesome !
the ladies there a spectacular !
great place- food was excellent , for the most part .
worst buffet i 've ever eaten at .
nobody is responsible and you just leave guests hanging ?
booked this hotel for a business event -- meeting room and several guest rooms .
we got no help and no assistance from management .
first off : i hate car buying .
it was like a canned tomato with some sweetness .
will definitely be going there again !
the bathroom could sure use a makeover , but was clean enough .
ok excalibur is n't a great hotel .
the shrimp were also extremely small and appeared to be slimy and undercooked .
sangria ( we had the red ) was good , but not outstanding .
did n't get that , got ground beef instead .
spago is one of the best reasonably priced restaurants in las vegas .
thanks but free drinks are already provided when i gamble .
the hotel as a whole is dated .
i liked the very contemporary decor .
two visits ago , just after new year 's i was disappointed .
something you `` have '' to get when your in vegas !
one being that the toilet was making a lot of noise .
charging _num_ is bullshit too .
the food was quick and fantastic !
they are so friendly and really care .
they were both great .
drinks and service always deliver !
if we could 've gotten a room elsewhere we would have .
they 're so ridiculously good .
big fan of this place !
sounds like this place gets pretty packed .
not only that , they have horrible customer service !
this place does not deserve any stars .
everything on the menu is delicious !
come one , this is _num_ !
he is the best !
i feel i have to say about my terrible experience in alize .
it hit the spot that was for sure .
either way , i enjoyed this venue because of our amazing waiter .
of course their pizzas are great as well !
but the employees were so unprofessional and unsafe .
the bacon does n't have any taste .
the next strike was the deal breaker .
no security camera on the hallways .
no security camera on the hallways .
they will not honor warranty .
best meal i 've had so far on this trip !
it was kind of gross .
i do not know what is wrong with them .
very enjoyable and the service was excellent .
i was there for a convention , not gambling .
service was excellent too .
i requested _num_ attached rooms for my party .
i 've had a better sleep in holiday inn .
not too bad but what i did see dirty was gross .
lettuce wraps are great .
this one , however , not so much .
i will definitely be back .
i will definitely be back .
i will definitely be back .
our particular room was very dark even with all the lights turned on .
the dessert was good , but not amazing .
i ordered the beef carpaccio and chicken with the sauce on the side .
delicious chopped salad and margherita pizza .
rude , disrespectful , and way too much attitude .
it was awful for a supposed upscale joint .
this place off the strip really nails it !
they made my vision come completely true !
this is my favorite restaurant in vegas .
extremely rude and very unhelpful .
i 've had cheesesteaks in philly several times and this does not compare .
the only area that has wifi is the conference rooms .
worst experience in vegas ever .
now back to the dirty dining situation this place could use some love .
i did n't sit in it or set my luggage on it .
the food was excellent and the portions were quite big .
_num_ $ in savings but nothing 's worth getting .
based on that along , i will never stay here again .
food was delicious and ambiance sophisticated .
i let it go thinking the smell would go away after a while .
harrah 's said , `` no prob . ''
i even feel comfortable using it alone .
me , i think harrah 's sucks .
i came here with my date and spago lived up to expectations .
would recommend this to families with young children .
always excellent service and good food at a reasonable price .
it smells delicious ! ''
i did n't finish my food .
a very good hotel with clean rooms above _num_ star i should rate .
so many yummy flavors , good god !
they also serve nice yummy mojitos by the pitcher .
good coffee and my breakfast burrito was great .
lets start with the sangria .
do not go here thinking you 're getting a great dinner .
definitely coming back next time we 're in town !
the food was all very fresh and tasted great .
it was just horrible .
the shower head sprayed all over the ceiling and walls .
i was there with another male friend and we are not sharing a bed .
definitely one of the highlights of my trip to vegas .
also , the outdoor venue is so fun .
you ca n't find a cheaper place around to practice at .
laughing , the server pointed to the empty lobster tank .
i will return next time in vegas .
if you love sushi then you know it is not cheap .
what a great find on our recent trip to vegas .
everything that we ate was absolutely delicious and seasoned well !
people this is _num_ what are you thinking off ?
one of my top ten restaurants of all , hands-down .
our waiter jerry was awesome !
i just love this place for lunch !
i was not a fan of the dingy vibe just walking in here .
overall : the rooms were fine but the customer service was appalling .
and as for the arcade a lot of the games were not working .
great food great drinks and good service .
they use a mechanical car washer and dry your car by hand .
it is the best thing i have ever drank .
please do n't make the same mistake i did and waste your time here .
no excuse for this .
bring your own ammo .
these employees are complete morons .
as soon as the elevators opened , the smell was overwhelming .
wow , i really needed this meal .
the salmon was amazing .
toilet did n't flush properly .
when we addressed it they said it was okay and proceeded on talking shit .
the absolute and worst customer service i have ever received in my entire life .
some negatives ... you can call ahead to request your car from valet .
paris and all the other related hotels was booked .
i stayed here and hated it .
i have more to say but i just do n't feel like it .
pizza was wood fire and amazing .
a delight to work with .
very rundown hotel room .
maybe the cook had a bad night .
i was very disappointed with this property .
cooked to a perfect med rare .
its also a fun place to gamble slots seem pretty loose .
then after i fed my kids the crap they gave me .
these cheesesteaks are no longer the ( pop ) pride of philly .
finally found one here .
i just used my iphone !
also there drinks are so good and happy hour is from 9pm to close !
just got home from vacation .
i did n't expect the ritz , but this place is just plain nasty .
the bathroom was extremely spacious and we were given plenty of towels .
the room felt like a motel rather than a hotel .
not until our recent trip to vegas that we will never go back again .
the smooth & creamy gelato is an absolute delight !
what happens in vegas does not stay there .
i dont want to give them even one star .
plain and simple , the lobby in here has seen better days !
the food was spectacular and the service was above average .
the sushi rice was too sweet .
the quality of furniture is very low end .
the veal was overcooked and drowned in sauce .
it was delicious and had huge chunks of fresh salmon in the spread .
it was n't the best looking hotel .
tips : perfect spot for groups ( there 's something for everyone ) .
this is a great store to look for clothing for any occasion .
i highly recommend it !
i highly recommend it !
this place is definitely one of the best local favorites in vegas .
some traditional tapas , some relatively unique .
i asked for the name , and i could not have it .
bacon almond dates are amazing .
we walked in and everything we knew was gone .
the smell of the lobby is pretty bad .
worst hotel experience of my life !
never seen such a horribly designed parking structure at a convention center .
she had fun and enjoyed the food .
this place just really needs an overhaul to bring it up to speed .
however , service is lacking .
as much as i come to this denny 's , i hate this location .
it 's definitely cheap to stay here , but why would you want to ?
but ... and it 's a big one - the room sucked .
he comes back sometime later with the same dish with the same chicken cooked .
places like this should not be running .
when i first walked in , everyone was friendly enough .
thank you for great service !
my seabass was moist and buttery , just how i like it .
the ice cream is pretty pricy as well .
the food was pretty good and the dishes were very unique .
she is talented beyond belief .
it was good and fresh .
definitely some good peruvian food .
placed a order for wings french fries and fried green beans .
oh and they have a great selection of drinks as well .
what a super afternoon all of us had .
who the hell voted for this place ?
they must have pretty low standards !
maybe there 's a food shortage in vegas .
i am seriously so grossed out , i ca n't even fall asleep .
the location is fantastic for visiting the strip .
my idea of the perfect address .
the hallways seem to be a little newer than the rooms .
: ) it made for a really great food memory .
instead of helping the situation , she wanted to get rid of me quickly .
sorry larry , your employee just pissed off a valuable customer .
i 'm not a fan of this casino or their rooms .
it flat out sucks here .
also some very awesome shoes , coach is definitely on the up and up !
everything here is so delicious !
great prices compared to some of the places in hotel pool areas .
i do n't care about the fee i care because he lied to us .
fabulous italian food , and wonderful old vegas ambience .
good mix of flavors but i would avoid the calamari .
vacation time is precious and excalibur does not get out !
but no , more lies and excuses .
definitely worth a stop next time in vegas !
the food here is excellent .
unfriendly clerk at counters .
no i didnt mean no wifi , i mean no internet !
you guys are awesome !
however , i do believe i 've tasted much better tapas before .
this place is still really okay .
the swimming pool was down right scary .
pillows were comfortable and the covers were nice and warm .
i 'm gon na say that i 'll probably not stay here again .
room was $ _num_ weeknight , $ _num_ weekend .
they should have paid me to stay here .
i dare you name a place in vegas that comes anywhere close .
he 's the sexy bartender there .
do not go to pop 's cheese steak resturant .
prices were fair ( most games $ _num_ ) .
which any other bank takes to cash one of there own checks .
our server josh was superb , full of fun and knowledge about the menu .
and their lox cream cheese spread is awesome !
mark our waiter was the worst i have ever had in vegas .
ask for oscar , he is so sweet and knowledgeable !
ordered a large pep pizza , chicken tenders , and chilli fries .
food was bland and service was not the greatest .
there were no cabs outside .
this is the worst place i have ever had my hair done !
$ _num_ a pound .
i will probably stay here again if the price is right next time .
i also had their veal parmesan which was rich and super tasty !
a full dollar more than the already overpriced menu ?
almost $ _num_ for eggs , bland potatoes and sausage links .
too bad you ca n't get drunk off their stingy well drinks .
night time , it looks better , but then everything looks better at night .
but no those prices do n't matter !
great ambiance and drinks .
anyways thank you all and keep up the good work .
at best , everyone 's dish was mediocre .
great service and such a good deal for happy hour !
the fish was greasy and breading had no seasoning .
so why the _num_ ?
i will definitely be visiting this shop again !
one of the all time worst meals i 've ever had .
anyway , fish was ok.
the roasted mussels were very good indeed .
this is a great , relaxing restaurant -- you must eat there !
he said he just needed to use drain cleaner and everything was fine .
did i mention the service was atrocious ?
they sincerely apologized and refunded us about the situation we had to go through .
the stay itself was alright .
i way it could be cleaned .
just thought i would give a good review where it deserved .
just okay : room , service , pool , prices .
great service and on-time .
as a regular customer at discount firearms , i would highly recommend this store .
its a lot of fun not only for kids but adults as well .
the food was delicious and served in very generous amounts .
must have been a bad day ?
the only thing this place has going for it is the view .
friendly service but the wait for the food is out of this world .
unfortunately there is little choice in the desert , which i also hate .
very romantic and elegant .
we went here for the 2nd time last night and everything was great !
it became unbearable to simply walk in and out of the hotel !
not a normal amount like you would in a normal soy sauce dipping tray .
complete waste of my money .
the new bathrooms were bigger and clean , food was excellent .
excellent margaritas and awesome sangria .
then they asked me to pull into the first bay again .
too bad that this place was n't that great .
if i could rate this place _num_ stars i would !
they also charge over $ _num_ per day for a resort fee .
if you want excitement , take $ _num_ and go to las vegas .
nice location , conveniently on the strip .
do n't stay here !
terrific sangria and a massive selection of tapas that includes some real winners .
i had the short rib and it was very good .
according to one member of our party , the mojito was amazing .
salads , pizza and pasta are all good .
great service and fast cooks !
both were fresh and tasty .
highly recommend for families .
do n't come here if you want to stay because of the service .
this place only has one pool but it was a good one .
staff was great as well .
the next night we ordered sweet and sour chicken and it was soooo good !
do n't waste your money !
loved the test tube !
but still ... there are way better malls here in vegas .
what kind of hotel does not have wifi ?
it 's short and sweet !
they did n't try n even help .
my favorite restaurant of all time .
has a great time !
more proof that you can wrap most anything in bacon !
i told them several times that the problem is something other than the bulb .
we wo n't be returning .
we wo n't be returning .
this place has won awards , had to try it .
we also eat here on our way out of vegas .
awesome food , that 's all i have to say .
though check in is a mile long , the casino floor is surprisingly empty .
the staff here knows their stuff and are very professional .
best bagels in town .
the staff is friendly and truly dedicated to their customers .
keep in mind we had a car .
the lady i had was not very professional at all .
the restaurants that i recommend are vince neal 's and the buffet .
thrown in the towel ?
anyway , the rooms are the pretty standard low budget hotel rooms in vegas .
horrible turnover from one server to the next .
wine list is grand , and the service was outstanding !
car was n't that clean .
the ambiance and vibe just add to everything .
not particularly flavorful or delicious .
the labor per hour rate was $ _num_ !
the service are great as well .
zero stars would be too generous for this crap hole .
make sure you triple check your home before you purchase your home through them .
always fresh , always delicious !
very disappointed very annoyed very frustrated .
it was paper thin and did n't offer any warmth or comfort .
you ca n't just blame excalibur .
our room was looking at a wall and trash exit of some restaurant .
times have changed , but excalibur remains stuck in the middle ages .
would never ever return to stay .
it was our anniversary & we went here with a big group of friends .
best bagels and breakfast in town .
we ordered a `` popcorn lobster '' roll ...
this meal , was just amazing .
a short distance off the strip but well worth it .
this hotel smells ... ew i would never stay here .
the best thing about this hotel is the location .
i absolutely loved madame tussauds !
thanks also for the smooth move in .
paying hotel rates for a pull out couch was like visiting the parents .
house keeping did not come once in _num_ days .
torn wallpaper and mold are your most common decor .
the food is delicious .
the food is delicious .
the food is delicious .
the food is delicious .
stayed here during my first time in vegas .
i know , in vegas , people smoke .
i know , in vegas , people smoke .
just another way for the hotels to take your dollars away .
room was clean and perfect .
fun and excitement - this is a one stop shop hotel .
ca n't take food to go unless you sit down .
it was a truly strange and awful experience .
barely opened , but most rooms are completely sealed .
and the smell of smoke is all over the casino floor .
my family will come back again and will recommend it to everyone .
portions and quality went down quite a bit .
business dinner , staff was very professional , good selection of wine .
that is the only reason this place gets _num_ stars .
great menu , fast service , nice atmosphere , reasonable prices .
anyways back to the crappy hotel that is the excalibur .
it did not come with a microwave , fridge , or a view .
the location is perfect .
the location is perfect .
not at any price not free not for a fee .
and i would n't recommend this place at all .
it has a local feel that was a treasure in sin city .
the location is perfect right in the middle of the lv strip .
do not get the buffet .
ambiance was warm and intimate .
the gravy was all but tasteless white goo .
the shrimp and lobster linguine pasta is good and they give you a lot !
all of the poor reviews are right .
back in town , and made this my dinner stop .
some real traditional mexican cooking with good quality fresh ingredients .
ok , really , there are n't many problems to complain about .
it has nice atmosphere , good mexican food , and good service .
polo towers never again !
i was pretty disappointed with their front desk customer service .
such a great restaurant !
seriously the worst place ever .
we can only assume it was food poisoning .
open pretty late as well .
came here for a friend 's bday celebration this weekend .
the ultimate pina colada is refreshing .
a little disappointing for a hotel on the strip .
just as they were at every other location , they are unmatched and delicious !
but then i also noticed that they opened my car hood ?
this place was very good .
but stay , because the tapas are so good .
no meat and disappointing .
their front office staff is apparently really bad and has no customer focus .
the room itself was pretty good .
next time i will have to make sure to get here for happy hour .
las vegas style mexican cuisine at its best .
not only was my blow dry something out of the 80s .
the service was very rude and unfriendly .
best macy 's in las vegas !
the food was so incredibly delicious .
service was great also .
i got my make up done at the mac counter .
we all ended up happy and stuffed .
trash on the floor and someone had obviously been laying on the bed .
i eventually canceled my order because everybody was almost done with their food already .
we got a cheap rate and along with that you get an average room .
not a fan of the philly cheese steak here .
i was told someone would contact me within _num_ days , never happened .
drinks were good and food was perfect !
i had tuna tartar and it was the best i 've ever had .
the monorail is good for when going to trade shows at the convention center .
the food itself was pretty tasty .
this place has really good food period .
next time i come to vegas i 'll add that extra shot lol .
great tasting and loaded drinks too .
from the bar to our table everything was perfect !
what wonderful bagels they make !
parking is at least easy and admission is free .
so i am like the old grandma playing slot machines .
go elsewhere cause this is not worth it .
i wish i had read the other reviews before booking .
yikes , can anyone really eat $ _num_ worth of crappy food .
the food was fantastic !
the food was fantastic !
it was soooo good !
the food is great and the prices ca n't be beat .
great service and they are open late !
they are dishonest and the ownership is extremely rude .
just jump right on in .
i 've already given this place a second chance .
best spot before hitting up the clubs .
no one has returned our multiple calls and emails .
their paella was fresh , authentically seasoned and reasonably priced .
sparse would be one word that comes to mind .
the filet mignon sliders were delicious !
it just seemed old and stale and dirty .
came back for apps and drinks for happy hour hopping ... .
we also tried a sushi roll as well and it was also very good .
for drinks , we ordered the jalapeo margarita and it was really good .
i would not stay here again even if they paid me .
if you are a sushi snob then this is not your place .
off the beaten path , the service was excellent and the food was excellent .
the place is just straight up trashy .
i love the atmosphere , music , it 's so much fun .
anyway , the bell people were super rude .
this place is amazing and bar service is exceptional !
i could n't wear them anymore and took it back .
i loved the monorail .
would recommend this place !
well , after the terrible service the beer just did n't taste very good .
too many places in here closed down in recent years .
being in so cali my whole life , we are mall snobs .
helpful staff ; the buffet is great for the price .
should have just driven away , worst , liquid , overpriced shake ever .
so many choices , great store !
the food is awesome too .
look - david and his staff are the best .
i ca n't even right a review except for the worst service ever .
choice of red , white , or sparkling .
that information was obviously wrong .
alot of cool memorabilia throughout the place too .
the bar is impressive ask bruce to mix you a drink !
the service was beyond poor and the stromboli was a total disappointment .
i probably wouldnt check this place out again .
my advice for an old , rundown property like this ?
the lack of cleanliness is very evident in this hotel .
_num_ min later still no server .
$ _num_ later , i was bummed .
there house made dressing is wonderful .
best of the best in las vegas so far .
great for kids of all ages .
oh well , at least this place provided me with another place to yelp !
wait staff ( james ) was professional , attentive , engaging and fun !
wall paper was peeling and table had sticky stuff on it .
the place is beautiful and bright , and has a perfect ambiance .
i was disgusted to get into the shower even .
she said we would have to find out on our own .
otherwise , a decent night can become an embarrassing nightmare .
excellent tapas restaurant with a spectacular view and reasonable prices !
the worst hotel experience ever !
it then took another _num_ or _num_ minutes before we got our drinks .
omg this place is awesome .
guess this guy missed vegas _num_ .
watch out , it 's addictive .
i asked guest services to come up _num_ different nights and nobody ever came .
the spa was the worst experience i have ever had in a spa .
it 's located in a strip mall and parking can be tight .
for me it was the first cocktail of my day and made to perfection .
it 's so frustrating !
i got a very very very good wig and very much worth the money .
excellent customer service ... and the jerk shrimp is the best ever ... .
it was a nice relaxing comforting lunch to end our fun trip in vegas .
no one came to the table to check on us and follow-up .
the service however was very poor .
dont know why we keep coming back .
the chips and salsa to start were fresh and really good .
the towels are cheap and stiff .
what kinda cheap spit is that ?
looks like it has n't been upgraded in _num_ years .
brought back to office and had rave reviews .
everything from the music to the food to the table candles was wonderful !
if you have , i think you can pass on this one .
this is the worst for a disabled person to have to go through .
the mushroom ravioli is full of flavor .
it was delicious and the drinks were amazing .
its quite a shame .
one word : gross .
what a disappointment for our girls ' getaway weekend !
the cilantro rice has a really great fresh taste to it .
the whole experience takes approximately one hour and is definitely worth it !
show just ok , long line to get drinks .
harrah 's is old vegas , meaning smokey and nasty .
the mojitos pitchers are good , not the best but good .
still , the tapas and sangria are great .
the food and sparkling sangria are amazing !
go for drinks , for outdoor sitting , for good talks and good food .
i 'm one happy camper !
the sangria was okay and the infused vodka was actually really good .
we ate at many places and by far spago had the best service !
the more i hit this spot , the more this place hits the spot .
the dinner roll was a french bread loaf cut in half .
the service is good and the servers are always friendly .
the service is great and the drinks are never more than $ _num_ .
spring rolls are amazing !
but i 'm also not thrilled with the excalibur .
this place is very quiet , mellow , and intimate .
good food , good drink , good company = good time .
old school italian vegas at its finest !
she really was exceptional !
you might wait a while to get in but it 's worth it .
wow what a great place to eat in vegas !
so suggesting you do a togo order instead of sitting .
also extremely ghetto looking employees .
he doesnt offer to give me another one and was very rude .
my recommendation is that nobody else bother him either .
thoroughly enjoyed my don julio _num_ with their excellent chips and salsa .
it was perfect and i 'm quite picky about steak .
our room was not that great .
it was hard , dried out , and had no flavor .
the shower had very low water pressure and there was no tub .
what kind of a vegas hotel does n't have wifi in _num_ !
katie , the instructor , was incredible .
the crazy thing is that it is reasonably priced as well !
the shower ( no tub ) was dingy .
probably so good its comparable to homemade filipino food from my in laws .
a dollar less maybe _num_ cents ?
such an amazing job .
my wife and i sat down and we ordered .
no other major casino on the strip left such a negative impression as excalibur .
oh yeah ... dick 's last resort ?
oh yeah ... dick 's last resort ?
shame on the city .
they were huge and so tasty !
i highly recommend going to the perfect princess cut .
the room smelt funny , like moldy .
the casino is not great .
plenty of apologies , but none were apologies for using pathetic unsafe practices .
the room was decent , but unclean .
the steak was burnt and the mushrooms for the side tasted canned .
we have tried almost everything on the cafe menu and love it !
totally worth every penny .
i could 've paid a little more and stayed at a nicer place .
the worst customer service i have ever received at a bank .
best bagels in vegas .
leave our luggage with her and come back at _num_ am to check in .
the sweet chipotle bbq sauce perfectly complimented the barbacoa .
this place was not closed for `` renovations '' .
they 're known for their osso buco , which is delicious .
there 's so many things wrong with this place .
the only positive thing about hotel was the food choices .
rude or boring dealers and house keeping rushed us out .
this place is an awesome dive .
i had dinner there last night and it was amazing .
i recommend you try their paella !
best deal on drinks in vegas !
sorry , but the cheddar biscuits are n't enough to bring me back .
the only thing it has going for it is location .
it was a mess , i was very disappointed .
it was so fatty and disgusting looking .
now i ca n't wait to leave and find another hotel .
great quality for the price .
not acceptable , i am very , very , very disappointed .
the beds were hard as a rock and the blankets were thin and cheap .
i stayed here for an entire week for business in july _num_ .
not sure i care to give this place another try in the near future .
early morning visit approx 3am .
fantastic restaurant ; great service , great food .
service is always the best here .
the toilet wouldnt flush .
there are two floors filled with an array of wonderful nike products .
tacos were seasoned well and tres leches ... cake was heavenly .
she does not address any of your concerns .
i stayed here during the last week of june .
the pizza was cooked perfectly .
definitely a bucket list kind of thing !
this was actually a wonderful hotel in a very convenient location .
overall great experience -- we will definitely be back !
very fast ride to destination .
huge drinks for a reasonable price .
i was quite impressed and picked up the ring that day !
this is a very good tapas place on paradise .
it was a very positive experience !
this was a terrible decision .
checked in valentines to get married the next morning .
there are no good restaurants here .
i 'm a happy drunk .
i am never going to stay in this hotel ever again .
started with the lettuce cups , a perfect light appetizer .
i can only hope that the food at my wedding will be this good .
this place was outstanding .
truly disappointing that this place has turned into a joke .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
enjoyed the lunch though and he picked up the bill !
the food and service is alway consistent .
i would recommend to anybody i know .
it 's convenient and easy to get to different part of the strip .
stayed here the weekend of june 5th with my cousin and it was amazing .
not classy , even if you are a cheaper hotel .
the shelves are usually empty .
from my experience , breakfast seems to be the best meal in the buffets .
all the food was great and so was the sangria .
firefly did an outstanding job of serving up both items .
firefly did not the mark for me or the rest of my table .
why do n't you tell me when i called ?
to add insult to injury , it was the most expensive night of all .
celebrated my wife 's bday here .
almost everything we had on the menu was sooo good .
but be careful , these drinks are strong !
the service from the front desk was above average .
when we return to vegas , i guarantee we will be back !
great environment and service was terrific .
my view looks like i 'm looking at a prison .
i will not purchase a home from this company again ... moving soon .
save your money and avoid this scam .
portion size is just perfect !
they treated me as if i was stupid .
they overcharged me _num_ times ridiculous !
and of course the bread that comes with it - yummy !
everything i tasted was fresh , excellently presented , and tasty .
there was no flair and no charm .
the complimentary breads are tasty and beautifully served and the desserts are just okay .
this very smoky hotel seems old and outdated .
i 'm pretty sure all of the stores have locations elsewhere in vegas anyways .
the best part however , was the cilantro rice .
i loved this marriott .
room smells great and staff very friendly .
customer beware , this is a horrible outfit .
we will definitely be back to explore more of the menu !
it 's a great spot for something different than the usual strip spots .
seriously ... nothing to expect here .
this is my new laundry spot !
not fresh and fishy .
we both enjoyed the thin crust and liked how it was not really doughy .
really nice if you have little ones in tow while in vegas .
staying here because my friends are ... no !
great equipment and location !
the drinks were great too .
luckily i had my student id and paid $ _num_ .
this is like a grown up disney world .
we were pleasantly surprised .
very polite and knowledgeable .
i would recommend walking down to new york new york .
the menu provides a wide variety of food .
yep , no bell men .
the staff is fairly friendly and very accommodating .
for $ _num_ extra dollars .
good atmosphere even though it is technically in a busy mall .
our waiter was mexican , and had some good recommendations about what was good .
i got a tiramisu and dear god i was in heaven !
its a classy and memorable resturant .
i had to spend a week in this garbage pit .
the waitress neglected to ask the birthday girl what she wanted to drink .
the hotel is ok nothing special but not horrible .
definitely must go back !
thanks to discount firearms !
had the smoke salmon toast and it was delicious .
i definitely like that they are in fashion show mall .
not sure how tower ii is .
came here on a whim with my parents and girlfriend .
and i 'll bet you will be back !
my family and i really enjoyed our first visit to bahama breeze .
great family owned shop been coming to here for years now .
not really crispy ... .
she then left my table and returned with a pizza sauce for the stromboli .
i love these shoes .
it was so tough you could barely chew it .
i love this spot !
we had a great time at circus circus !
the bread was dry and the chicken was bland .
i was not refunded the deposit and it was charged to my credit card .
a total waste of money .
i am so insulted .
fortunately for i it was endless shrimp time at red lobster .
not much to do over here .
_num_ octane w/ and extra shot .
they did fix it for free but for it to keep happening is ridiculous !
i loved the super hero movie adventure .
maybe some people like this , but i sure did n't .
great lively atmosphere , good drinks , cool hangout spot for small groups .
sucks for us cause it 's our loss cause we have to fix it .
the beef empanadas and coconut shrimp is flavorful .
the service was very good .
the service was very good .
the service was very good .
without fail , both times they did it with a smile on their face .
shopping here is a lot of fun .
room was clean staff was friendly ... excellent point system !
some random false alarm at _num_ am does n't help its case either .
this was by no means fun !
love the bacon wrapped dates and the mac and cheese really surprised me too .
you will be treated much better a few doors down !
the restaurant is loud and small and very high energy .
i love the watermelon margarita .
like a chain restaurant , straight out of a can .
the drinks were strong , the food amazing , the service top notch !
she was incredibly helpful and friendly !
my dinner companion had the rigatoni and the summer squash salad .
there were stains all over the carpets in the rooms as well .
they take time with you to find what you 're looking for .
made it on time for their happy hour !
the food here is good .
room was clean , bathroom was fine .
everything was great from the setting to the food .
the reviews on the buffet ( included in our reservations ) were horrible !
just a comfortable spot to enjoy good food .
our room was descent , but this review will focus more on the casino .
are you effing kidding me ?
are you effing kidding me ?
service was great , even with a gluten allergy present .
spago is what makes vegas special .
even the maintenance men knew how bad this management company was .
well , we fell for it and did it .
harrah 's was filthy , inefficient and sad .
i guess we will have to wait to watch the place blow to pieces .
lots of vegetarian options !
it really was the best day ever !
rooms are totally outdated .
our hotel room was clean and tidy , nothing special though .
the rooms were just plain rooms i could have gotten at best western !
i will come back !
the amount of smoke was terrible .
unlv even voted it best bar .
get some better food in there , it 's _num_ not _num_ .
had to go up _num_ floors for an ice machine !
i chose a different color just in case it was that one batch .
not good , not bad .
the furniture is very dated , but they do have big flat screen tvs .
wan na take a nice shower ?
my main course was halibut and that was perfectly cooked .
i will not be staying at this hotel ever again so bye bye excalibur .
we enjoyed this restaurant .
this place had friendly and attentive bartenders .
if i could give negative stars i would .
i recommend to try everything in the menu .
we only went there because we had just arrived and were starving .
overpriced , incorrect and unbelievable !
thanks making me best brother this christmas .
needless to say , i did not have good sleep at all .
must visit local spot in vegas !
husband ordered the stuffed tilapia , sorry , out of it at 4:30 pm !
all in all i 'm pretty disappointed with this hotel .
no tub was a huge turn off for me .
inexpensive stay , expect inexpensive quality .
food always tastes fresh .
food was great and super fresh and the service was amazing !
after their responses , i will continue to give marriott hotels my business .
ok , seriously , dude .
the house specialty was great - ask the staff to make the recommendation !
with their reasonable price , friendly waitress and tasty food .
its a giant mess .
`` no problem ! ''
anything longer than a day or two and i would n't stay here .
we ordered the flautas & the chicken enchiladas , they were delicious !
you 'll thank yourself for doing it .
location is right in the middle of the strip !
this is a great place for that `` wow '' factor .
all of it was amazing .
we have been waiting for _num_ hours for the checking line to get shorter !
i really like it and i actually prefer it to the forum at caesars .
the customer service was outstanding .
a great time and we will definitly be back .
she never even refilled my ice tea .
still , the flavor was very unique and good .
they have a $ _num_ hold on you card like what the fuck .
very dismissive , unhelpful , usually rude .
however service sucks _num_ stars .
this place was great .
this place was great .
this place was great .
went alone and will not be going back to this hotel .
circo restaurant at the bellagio is one of the nicest restaurants on the strip .
being kept waiting at tables for _num_ mins without service ?
the restrooms are located outside the building , not readily visible or available .
the pasta was fresh and the ice cream was really delicious .
i always get the mango flavor !
you could n't give this to me for free .
yes , the store looks nice - both inside and outside .
casino floor : _num_ stars .
i absolutely adored this place .
the dressing rooms were filled with all the vintage decor that i love !
after _num_ nights and no improvement i called the front desk .
finding a decent bagel outside the ny area has been a challenge .
great food & fruity drinks .
i have a same experience like judy in this review .
that 'll be $ _num_ for ten minutes on the internet please .
go somewhere else if you want to spend $ _num_ .
be warned , if they open again .
the pool was so gross and it 's freezing cold as well .
the tv also was not even close to hd .
this is a great hotel for families and an affordable price .
customer service not nice at all .
this is always our first stop when we drive into town .
the line moved fairly quickly .
they ordered breakfast ... .
was too tired to enjoy vegas that night .
i called and complained and the first manager did n't even compensate me .
the restaurant was n't busy but there were still a few full tables .
fat tuesday 's hits the spot !
overall i highly recommend them .
the prices are great but the people put this over the top !
i 'm not being snooty , but dang really !
i have been here a few times and i will keep coming back .
noodles - very authentic - just like singapore .
it was a great atmosphere !
it 's fresh unlike many others in socal .
although i 've definitely had better , it was great for the price .
the beds were hard as rocks !
food was great , especially the osso buco .
i have no desire to ever have it again .
the dates and mac and cheese are wonderful .
this is basically the same response i received .
we got _num_ wings sent back _num_ .
well looks like i will return asap .
its obvious the do n't vacuum here .
a security alarm went off twice while we were there .
do not use this lady !
this is what happens to a casino when it is not kept up .
first off , their ventilation system sucks ass .
overall disappointed in staying at this hotel .
i thought everything was great !
i called back to find out why he called and the boss did n't .
the room itself needs some work .
i loved this restaurant !
nurses go above and beyond .
came here for lunch with my boyfriend .
and again came out barely warm .
room service got a simple one entree order wrong .
what a terrible place .
audio staff is awful .
all in all , i would not stay there again .
the plate was elegant and tons of attention to detail .
staff friendly but they cant change the decor .
the best part is the location .
excellent food i did n't expected to be so authentic .
we only come here to see santa .
i highly recommend them .
i highly recommend them .
first , the food here was ridiculously overpriced .
circo 's is all around a lovely restaurant !
until they go back to the original recipe i will no longer eat here .
i 'm going to call them everyday until i get my damn money back .
it has a real deli feel to it .
great service great deli counter cooks .
the food and service is always impeccable .
very horrible ross i will never come here again .
love the lv monorail !
aside from the location , it 's not a bad mall to shop at .
also a balcony but we had a horrible view .
i had a great time browsing with my husband today .
but if you like food and being alive do not eat here !
they were all good but definitely recommend the garlic shrimp !
so , i set it at _num_ before going to gamble for the afternoon .
the white truffle mac and cheese is superb .
this range is a must go !
no one in that line will be staying at harrah 's again .
they were also extremely reasonably priced !
she was not helpful and sounded extremely cranky .
we also were expecting a bed but had a sofa bed instead .
my favorite part though is that the staff is friendly and very loving .
the food here is amazing .
definitely recommended for a fun girls night out !
before they have cooked so tender no knife needed .
i ordered the calamari for a starter and it was tasty .
i ordered chicken on the side and it was incredibly juicy .
wasted cab rides to and from the course .
they do not even have wifi .
service was n't so great either !
the disgusting food and poor service bothers me .
a must do for anyone !
i 've been here several times and every time it 's been perfect .
i live in vegas and i always enjoy going to firefly .
try the wrapped dates !
will most definitely be back again .
i will always buy from this location !
do n't do it unless you absolutely have to .
the burgers , pasta , and banana supreme is delicious .
firefly is the best tapas restaurant i 've been to yet !
this place is extremely understaffed .
_num_ : most fun casino on the strip for kids !
this place sucks compared to newer hotels .
they are not even sure if i can cancel my order after _num_ weeks .
but of course , i didnt say a word .
they do n't tell you online that there is a _num_ resort fee .
and the marinara was bland and tasteless .
they made us feel as comfortable as we could given circumstances .
* wifi would allow me to stay in my room instead of gambling .
our waitress was very slow .
for food , we ordered a guac for the table and it was delightful .
warranty for a _num_ $ battery .
the parking lot has no cameras .
i love visiting new department stores because everything is so new and clean .
we stayed at one of the stops .
second the service is slow .
i looked around and left , it was just too busy .
it is very reasonable .
anyways i strongly recommend eating here !
it was a refreshing combination of flavors .
she had a smile very unique to her .
she said i would need to pay for more alcohol .
the service is very good , i never had a bad experience .
ya , it 's pricy but it 's vegas , spago and sensational .
ya , it 's pricy but it 's vegas , spago and sensational .
this place is definitely a must when you go to vegas .
service was fantastic and the food excellent .
service is great , food excellent , prices are right .
we loved the environment .
excellent deli short drive from the strip .
the instructors were very careful and made sure it was a fun flight .
i highly recommend this to everyone !
the variety in food will please everyone .
i highly doubt it .
i can honestly say it was delicious , way better than i expected .
it is hit or miss .
cheap , for sure , but you get what you pay for .
it 's an older casino , but they really make it worth your while .
pricey , but good sized portions .
therefore i associate junk with the brand .
this place is a must when in lv !
devine ... and the price is right !
so we are upset but obviously need to catch some sleep .
do n't like the scam they 're running for the check-in discount .
this place is shabby , thoroughly unimpressed .
the eggs were cold and hash browns not cooked .
i was annoyed and got a different sandwich .
i always , always order with the extra shot for $ _num_ .
what a great hospital and er .
the casino , rooms , and restaurants are yuck .
the food is always amazing , both for the eyes and the palate .
but i always have fun here .
been a few years back and came back twice this time .
by far the worst burger i 've ever eaten in _num_ years .
i wo n't be going back though .
bedding very low end .
this is why people get sick .
otherwise go elsewhere because this hotel sucks !
service was friendly and quick and we will be back soon .
i am not kidding .
the waiters and waitresses are so nice and helpful .
my boyfriend and i spent three nights here last summer with no issues .
this is such a great little joint .
we paid $ _num_ with a _num_ % discount .
this was a great place once you get used to the noise .
i 'm not usually one to give bad reviews !
the food was delicious !
the food was delicious !
wonderful food and service .
they seemed genuinely happy to have my business and chatted pleasantly .
there was no i repeat no coffee maker in the room !
the food was great and the service was absolutely awesome .
the pitchers were inexpensive and the food was pretty good .
always wonderful food and made my wedding reception very special .
now the crust is soggy .
great meal ... great service .
awesome dinner and service .
excellent service , courteous and attentive .
very friendly , they work on commission , and great clothes !
shame on harrah 's .
maybe next time we visit we 'll try again !
i love that place !
thank you for everything !
great food and atmosphere !
the venetian and the bellagio are my two favorite spots on the strip .
check this one out if you are in the mood for mexican food !
so limit you visits to breakfast , we will if we return .
the place was empty & it took for ever .
we had a table with a view and the staff was really friendly .
just told myself not get ribs there anymore .
for my entree i ordered the orange chicken .
i had the green enchiladas and they were so good !
the room was clean , just not kept up well .
obviously i had the flautas and they were soooooo good !
fat tuesday is probably the best drink place in vegas .
i love firefly ... best tapas in vegas .
the filet mignon sliders are the best !
its only _num_ feet deep !
the registration process took _num_ minutes .
this is a florist with heart !
the food was alright , not amazing , but for sure a solid choice .
way overpriced and not enough wax figures to see .
the food was terrible .
the food was terrible .
i l 've only had a bagel sandwich but it 's wonderful !
mechanics might need some more training too .
just come here to get a great bagel .
the best calamari i have ever tasted in my life .
i do not recommend this place .
honestly i fell in love with our host .
over all i probably wo n't choose to stay here on my own .
and just be smart about partying if thats what you 're there to do .
the food sucks too , no taste , yuck to bland food !
besides that , however , everything else was mediocre at best .
not surprised to read his ratings at all .
great location on the strip for the wondering traveler .
it 's a much better value than taxis .
the servers could n't remember the names of the rolls .
those happy hours on the strip ca n't compare to their drinks .
each dish was so flavorful and perfect .
they add $ _num_ automatically when you use a credit card .
we loved everything about firefly .
unfortunately , this stay was simply not up to par .
worst service i 've ever had .
well done , everyone !
generous portions rule the day here .
very disappointed and would never go back .
the building is huge inside with a cool water feature as you enter .
great for a first date or friends from work !
the french toast and pancakes were hard .
the pharmacy is the worst i have ever been to .
also , the sparkling sangria is really delicious as well .
negative - wifi is awful !
i went today for a car wash and they have a new ownership .
a big location with plenty of inventory .
it was a huge mistake .
go back again _num_ days later - 10:30 am - closed again ?
gave it two stars instead of one because the waitress was nice .
i tried second bed and it was better but not great .
the customer service sucked .
gnocchi was outstanding , and the wine pairings were decent .
service was awesome and the food was good !
it 's operated by an automatic system vs a person which is interesting .
the first time i went here i got my oil changed .
my colleagues and i eat lunch there once a month .
it 's so lovely here !
great atmosphere , nice waitress , good service .
when i sat down , the bartender greeted me and i ordered a water .
and ... ... the walls are freakin ' thin .
the play place is so filthy , and it smells .
she was very attentive and gave us our space at the same time .
so i paid like $ _num_ more .
i 've cooked better stir fry at home .
food was simply amazing .
after many years of wondering , wonder no more .
i really hate to leave a bad review for this place .
would definitely return again !
there was n't enough staff on the floor to help .
my favorite place in vegas !
the occasion was my brother 's birthday dinner and this was his choice .
this is a hidden gem .
we had a few problems with the room though .
firefly satisfied all , immensely .
very positive folks work here .
this review is n't about this specific store , but about the company .
the place does have a starbucks and a american express open lounge .
the sangria was delicious and i loved the ceviche .
but no way would i skimp and book this place for a vacation .
if you do plan to stay here , please do n't have high expectations .
we also had a terrible view .
the smoke became overwhelming ... most casino 's have great ventilation .
the circus circus is an underrated hotel and casino .
everything was amazing from food to service .
like the hotel is trying to make it smell better .
great for business meetings or an intimate date .
the place is big the service is great .
thank you us wigs !
i enjoy their drinks and the indoor/outdoor patio area .
it 's so hard to make a decision !
worst customer service ever !
worst customer service ever !
worst customer service ever !
we even went as late like everybody 's recommended .
cheap , tacky decor seemed to be a big theme at this place .
this was not an inexpensive meal either .
still no one realized they had double booked the room .
the mojitos are deliciously made with fresh fruit .
a true vegas experience .
some where you would think ok this could happen or whatever .
not a good dining experience with every fly in las vegas in your face .
and i love hello kitty !
our room seems to be clean .
he told me he 'd bring me some biscuits and left .
i only ate here because my nephew wanted it for his bday .
the dealers in the casino were very friendly and helpful .
to bad there are n't negative stars !
overall , definitely one of my go to spots for fine dining .
i prefer it over cvs across the street .
great flavors , very creamy and rich .
great place to stay if you are on a budget .
it was all delicious !
the casino has a lot of different games .
i reached out to a manager to inform her of the horrible experience .
i sat at the bar with bob .
the monorail is a great service in vegas .
i had the tacos and were pretty good .
another extraordinary dining experience @ spago .
it was slow but still glad to have internet !
when we expressed our concern we never even received a phone call back .
interesting and very cheesy since the room was ready anyway .
the bathtub was n't very inviting , even for a shower .
highly recommend if you are in the area !
caesar salad is excellent !
thank you antonio and macy 's !
i 've had _num_ appointments at this clinic and i will never go back .
i was starving and had to get something else to eat .
this is a great place to go off the strip .
unless you got nothing to loose with you do n't go here .
there was plenty of blue cheese dressing .
the manager was wonderful and so accommodating .
bartender is great , and chinese restaurant attached is a trip and really good .
very nice place and bartender was a nice fellow .
the linens appeared clean and the towels were abundant .
we tried a couple of different items that were just disappointing .
firefly is one of my favorite restaurants in vegas .
the quality and presentation of the food is bad .
gave sassy one word answers to questions and refused to be helpful .
a+ good customer service .
_num_ sliders were seasoned and cooked perfectly .
met up with a friend for happy hour .
so maybe the _num_ out of _num_ of us , actually order food .
it 's like pouring chocolate over chocolate - it 's a little too much .
my boyfriend , his dad , and i stayed at harrahs .
seriously , security needs to take a giant step back .
great christmas decorations ... .
thank goodness they have a fashion mall location .
she did a wonderful job .
no bath tub just shower .
was n't really an upgrade , just a slightly larger room .
_num_ minutes later i got my coke .
the atmosphere is awesome , with a young crowd and good vibes all around .
my first hand experience is as follows .
worst part : i wrote one of the operations managers .
their faces changed right away they immediately became short and rude with me .
i feel like i do n't have any power to fight back .
the artwork on the walls made for some great atmosphere as well !
avoid this place at all costs .
i always love coming to this place .
and after all , it 's not his fault the kitchen is disgusting .
beware - this is n't your typical las vegas hotel .
so much flavor packed into each of the items !
not sure , but yuk .
they were so nice to us .
it left the floor very wet and yucky .
this place was the restaurant they used in the movie `` casino '' .
cons : poor housekeeping .
i 'd definitely return here for a great deal !
me and my wife will not be coming to this place again .
anyways both dishes highly recommended !
my room was the standard king size room and was an okay room .
i am struggling to find nice things to say about this place .
it was extremely small and parts of it were over cooked .
sangria is also quite good .
gross would never stay here again and i am pretty easy to please .
the service department is the worst i have ever seen .
always clean fast and very convenient !
i just did n't like the overall ambience .
the las vegas monorail was perfect for my recent trip to vegas .
this is a terrible place to shop .
the lack of wifi in the room was another huge turn off .
one of the worst hotels i 've stayed at in vegas .
food delicious and service perfect .
happy hour is where it 's at too .
so bad , that i had to post this .
i wish i could give them no stars honestly .
the deli bagels are the best and deli product is great !
best item on the menu is the bacon wrapped fig .
simply put this place is amazing !
great food and service .
great food and service .
the chef is really nice , he comes and talks to clients .
pretty good for breakfast .
she blew me off and told me i will have to wait .
stayed there recently with my husband and two daughters .
the bread is good as well .
an all around amazing experience .
and the room did not have a window that opened .
the room is very basic .
i finally fell back asleep and the trash service outside woke me up again !
probably one of the best places i have ever eaten at .
it 's been a nightmare to get anything filed .
if you want to get around the strip quickly this is the best route .
valet was friendly and efficient when checking my luggage for the day after checkout .
the service was superb .
so i am freaking pissed off .
a cool little dive cheap drinks nice atmosphere and good people .
slow to check in , old and parking lot smells .
rooms are spacious and comfortable .
just a hit or miss place for food and service .
if you lose something at this resort , you will never get it back !
the food and the service were excellent !
the bathrooms are also only okay .
he offered no assistance whatsoever .
i am not about to get into everything , but be warned .
would have been better off catching a cheap bite at the palms food court .
the outside of a building with four units ?
this place has charm .
i ended up getting a strawberry mango drink and it was delicious .
well it was no where in sight .
i like hopping into this location on my way into work !
reverse happy hour from _num_ pm to close is the best !
this was my go-to place for a long time .
as far as standard bathroom amenities go , this room was totally sub-par .
strong and got me buzzed .
the waitress was n't super friendly and their food runner was extremely rude .
order the tasting menu with wine pairing for an unforgettable meal !
go to any grocery chain they all use gloves !
we had a wonderful time last night .
hell the super _num_ across the way was a better stay than here !
this is so beyond acceptable , i am at a loss .
this time around it was awful !
make sure to get an extra shot too .
they also rushed us when it was our turn .
order their mojitos , they 're so good .
great food and wonderful staff , i 'm so glad i chose this place !
a stupid coupon book that did n't have much savings was what we received .
had a good time sharing all the tapas with the family .
i was very satisfied with my stay here !
the room had a old smell to it .
but all in all a wonderful dining experience .
one pizza is good enough for two .
one pizza is good enough for two .
i tried to call , but the phone rang and rang .
the most pathetic excuse for a salon .
there were peanuts and shells on the floor in the bedroom .
but like the previous posts mentioned , felt like a motel _num_ set up .
my car is n't very dirty in the first place .
pretty loud and super casual , lots of great menu options .
the lv monorail is awesome !
best apple store in vegas to come to .
the blow dryer did not work .
we were so in love with our wedding floral designs .
reeked of cigarette smoke , looked outdated and the staff looked dated too .
i said $ _num_ dollar for my time and gas .
it took me and my bf like forever to find it .
the lamb sandwich was over the top delicious .
hotel manager do n't have any authority to help us .
hotel manager do n't have any authority to help us .
feel like the chef had no passion on what they are cooking .
amazing food and sangria .
i felt gross knowing i stayed in that bed , used that hot tub .
the big kicker about this place was the terrible and useless concierge desk .
other than that love this place and ca n't wait for my next purchase .
the place looks old and tired .
it 's a disappointment that the service was subpar .
it was tiny and completely lacking any touch .
the lamb chops were especially very good !
hell , for the price , excalibur is n't that bad .
i would suggest bally 's or planet hollywood for the younger crowd .
we stayed in tower _num_ which is supposedly the nicer of the two .
we greatly enjoyed the dim sum and that 's all we ate there .
we greatly enjoyed the dim sum and that 's all we ate there .
but then again , upgrades make the room price go up .
then ordered their creme brulee for dessert that looked great and tasted great .
ok , here goes nothing ... .
and there was no fridge .
the food is done well and the ambiance makes the dining experience worthwhile .
my room was nice and clean .
the shrimp is very good .
we were here last year as well .
wo n't stay there again .
it was very much worth the price .
so i had to sleep with the tv on all night .
it was a stressful experience and i will never go back into that location .
fun place to eat , drink , and what else watch sports !
i was very happy with the decision .
i love this restaurant/bar !
locals and our la friends recommended this place to us .
avoid this place like the plague .
avoid this place like the plague .
this seemed like a great solution - and it was !
the 1st impression when we walked into out room was omg !
always cute things available and affordable .
this place is a disgrace .
excellent food and service .

i 'm never coming back to this sushi place .
the mushrooms are gross - straight from the can .
the lobster mac was bland but okay !
pop 's philly steaks they wont let me post on their wall any more .
all in all circus circus will always have my business !
very outdated and we booked a king room .
i did n't actually stay here , i 'm just reviewing the ambience .
this was my second time at this spago and it was fantastic .
to put it in perspective think your average cafeteria cheese steak .
too bad though cause dr .
for my birthday i decided to get my industrial piercing in my left ear .
so many things and very affordable .
when i say horrible , i mean just embarrassing .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
the food was excellent , thank you chef eric !
we should have rented palms place for $ _num_ a night .
customer service- horrible could not describe it .
i have n't been here recently but it 's a fun family-friendly place .
the shops are cute , and there are so many options .
we found this lovely place inside the venetian hotel and made an online reservation .
he said it was one of the best restaurant meals he had ever had .
so far so good .
parking sucks so bad !
i thought that was very nice of them to do .
got a comped room for _num_ nights here .
thank you so much to the wonderful team at mac and adrian !
all in all , a good experience .
very good tapas and great selection of adult beverages .
sometimes rio is just too far from all the action so we stay here .
found out our room was not ready .
nice work harrah 's we will be back for more .
i got the mango and also the strawberry .
i love the atmosphere of this place .
if anyone ever has him as a dealer be sure to have some laughs .
perfect crust and just the right size .
everything is super tasty and delicious .
there went our upgrade and we had to cancel our dinner plans .
he was n't rude but lacked enthusiasm & was n't helpful at all .
the service is great , the prices good , and food is fun .
bad : housekeeping service .
she was so helpful and kind .
bartenders are super cool friendly people , always helpful and attentive .
the desserts are also really good .
i would recommend the place for sure especially after that experience !
i 'd definitely come back !
the veggies in my food were fresh and the service was friendly .
the shrimp ceviche was plentiful and fresh .
we had a great time here .
i ca n't write a review about the food as we never got ours .
i was there to relax , not be rushed by someone .
i was very disappointed with my shrimp stir fry .
weekends are always packed and there 's always a waiting period .
overall a great experience .
we are happy with the hotel so far !
however , this lobby absolutely reeked of cigarettes !
real , authentic italian cuisine .
i just got tired of calling .
the only good thing about this hotel is it 's location .
the sangria margarita was delicious as well .
i ca n't imagine what this place is like as a hotel .
i think the sauces for the dishes here are what really make them excellent .
dave , keith , justin are all amazing .
i am hoping they management reads this and takes appropriate actions .
to top it off the micheladas were cold and refreshing !
i gave them my name and waited .
the paella was really bad no flavor , the sangria no good .
i love this guy .
great service , and very professional .
the carpet is disgusting .
the edges of the carpet were thick with dust .
she is the best .
whoa she gave me very bad look like i am stupid .
the excalibur has turned into a 3rd rate piece of crap property .
i love the pool here .
this place is authentic and service makes you feel like a million bucks .
she then drives _num_ minutes back home .
: ) enjoy your dining experience , it wo n't disappoint !
awesome food and great service !
i checked out of this filthy place _num_ hrs later and will never return .
i usually hit up the one in the planet hollywood miracle mile mall .
i 'd rather go watch the bellagio fountains again .
it is seriously the greatest companion when walking around vegas strip .
everything is broken and the staff is rude .
i was n't tempted to take pictures with anyone .
the soup is great .
staff very friendly , the drinks are awesome and the prices are very reasonable .
but if you want some quite time the interior seating is best .
service was great as well .
sunday afternoon : we return to find our room clean .
also , our service rocked !
_num_ dollar for every arcade game ?
love the service here .
they were rude and completely horrible .
food was great and they even gave extra !
my food was nicely prepared and presented beautifully .
shout out to alex -- he was a great bartender !
almost everything was gourmet quality , enticing presentation , and top notch in flavor .
it 's such a shame because firefly has delicious tapas and drinks .
do n't even want to take a picture for the room .
nothing will satisfy but the real thing .
the spa only gets one star from me .
everyone had a clean plate .
like earl 's , this place is a must during a vegas trip .
i won her a stuffed dog at the water shooting horse race game .
it was n't bad , but very basic .
they 're not open until tuesday .
stayed here for _num_ nights on a recent trip .
funky colors , bold styles , everything a strong personality would love to don .
this place is good to the guest .
i stayed at this hotel as a week from my parents ' timeshare .
i loved everything about this place !
i did n't want to take my shoes off .
relieved the food was n't as bad as our service .
we sat and enjoyed our drinks and meal .
this business does not use customer service practices .
just was not a good experience for me .
the door frame that houses the numbers was torn off .
the restrooms in the pool area were absolutely disgusting .
the service was also very professional and enjoyable !
i stayed here last year when i came with my family .
great atmosphere ; average service ; pretty people .
always seemed cheap feeling here .
and the service sucked .
very nice quality clothes and accessories .
love their _num_ for _num_ happy hour , the sangria is especially good .
some lady runs up to me screaming i cant park here .
overall it was great food , fast service , and cool atmosphere .
he got something with fish and spinach , which he liked .
dealers : be nice or you do n't get tips .
the staff ( thanks carlos from la ) was very friendly and helpful .
then when the clerk asks for my id she comments on my coach wallet .
staff are very friendly and quick on service .
any time an issue came up , it was someone else fault .
this place is classy and open to all with the restaurant attached .
the pilot was awesome and kept us informed the whole way their and back .
if only i had researched them before buying our home ... .
lots of midway games for the kids and some tiny free acts to watch .
i ate here and it was amazing !
i have to assume they are trying to cut costs and it shows .
or negatives , even .
the service was excellent !
the concierge was even rude .
our servers name was josh , and he was terrible .
good service , guacamole was very good too .
this place is really gross .
the service was fast so that always was a plus .
i recall having a pepperoni and mushroom pizza that was mostly grease and dough .
and then they made me sit for an hour .
he told me that there was nothing he could do for me .
the iron was broken so i could n't iron my clothes while i waited .
would not recommend this place at all .
paying _num_ $ for a pair of jeans is no bueno !
the tapas are very good and the sangria was really yummy .
we always get one of their pizzas .
they got a lot of the little things down , which is good .
this was the first stop on a week long vacation .
the finest restaurant i have eaten at in las vegas .
my surgeon gets _num_ stars .
tasted like it had sat in the garbage for a day .
yes i love vegas and fat tuesday helps me live through it .
fantastic food and absolutely excellent service !
and the food ... omg so on point !
fun crowd , great waiter .
totally recommend it but it does get busy .
this hotel is horrible .
if you could book a non-smoking room there was n't a mention of it .
the carpets stink , the rooms were not cleaned and also stunk .
we booked a room for _num_ nights at $ _num_ a night .
good spot for vegetarians and vegans as well .
funky strip mall like location but great food .
my son was here all the staff was great .
so i might as well review the room .
definitely a great place to eat !
our room got robbed in the middle of the night as we were sleeping .
i then inspected my car .
`` new york is very expensive '' .
i would not stay here again unless it was free .
you do n't serve kid friendly food !
the inside of my truck was not wet at all .
i 'll definitely come back just for the jerk shrimp !
did n't get any sleep .
this place does not deserve the stars that it has !
the service was pretty good .
do n't ever stay here !
absolutely , hands down the worst service i have ever had .
our first room in tower _num_ had missing wall plates for the outlets .
in fact , every dish ranged from very good to excellent .
it 's pretty bad when the circus circus does a better job .
their happy hour food is actually good .
the arcade below the excalibur ?
they also offered to remove the $ _num_ early check in fee .
the staff was nice and helpful .
so i walk back to the clerk and the manager to discuss this more .
the key word for our experience was : disappointment .
we will definitely go back again .
the place is small but really nice .
the bagel was great and the amount of lox they put on is yum !
got there for happy hour and enjoyed some `` cheaper '' drinks .
unfortunately we are stuck in this horrible room for the next _num_ nights .
am happy with the price but the service was alright .
super tropical and festive .
not impressed by this place at all .
- at least i did n't have to pay for it .
love love love the shoe department at this macy 's .
i will defiantly stay here again .
tasty drink , and friendly bartenders .
if the manager is reading this , all those bitches should be fired .
the food was delicious , however the service was horrible .
it is one of my favorite locations to eat at .
great price for the food .
still good food , good service , good location , good time !
oh man , i loved the paella , oh god !
thank you to all the nurses and docs that attended to my child !
nice location in the forum at caesars palace .
but everything is pretty good .
i booked a week in advance , for saturday and sunday night .
thanks to the chef who came out and talked with us .
i was super stoked to try this place despite my hubby 's reservations .
we came for lunch and the specials were really good .
the girl that was helping us was very friendly and personable .
i definitely recommend going here while in vegas .
also , i witnessed _num_ more people having trouble with their keys .
did n't care for it .
they refused to fix it .
gross , yuck , disgusting , stinky hell hole .
this is quickly turning into a trip into hell .
hope your experience will be the same !
our family visited here every day of our vacation .
_num_ minutes more , no car for me to see .
the most racist people ever and thieves !
open late and serves food late !
we just randomly searched this place online .
the taste and texture is totally different .
thank you team monorail !
so do n't upgrade .
the toilet ran the first night .
however , i did not like our family picture so much .
she first said none were available .
con : it 's excalibur at _num_ - falling apart .
always stop here in vegas !
the goat cheese was relatively bland .
and the workers are very friendly !
i 'm putting my foot down , this place deserves a one star rating .
a good place given the price point .
first of all the rooms are very outdated .
however the casino was nasty dirty .
tv does n't work 1/2 the time .
service - sucked , and they got my ribeye wrong !
other reviews have stated that tower _num_ is more updated than tower _num_ .
as far as rooms go , i would never recommend excalibur .
rooms were clean , food was great .
i wish i would 've rather stayed at flamingo for the same price .
we enjoyed a great lunch at spago .
- bacon wrapped dates are a must have !
was crispy and amazing .
the whole floor that my room is on smells like a locker room .
the air would shut off in the middle of the night .
the food was great .
and the entire hotel smells like stale smoke .
my wife said that her restroom was cleaner but no toilet paper .
but would n't go back .
for instance , there was only like _num_ channels that worked on the tv .
no coffee machines in the room ?
my boyfriend and i recently moved out of this nightmare of a complex .
first time staying here .
the staff was very rude , all of them .
the staff was extremely nice and helpful ; moreover , very patient with us .
and we definitely did !
the staff was friendly and helpful and the breakfast was free and actually good .
while the room was mostly clean and the casino was overly smokey .
the wife and i had no choice .
it 's so sad to see where this place gone .
they really were n't prepared for the pictures we were doing .
also , the trash was n't taken out at all .
and i love this location !
but it does the job .
all of the food in this casino is bad .
she said it might cost $ _num_ for a half day rate .
results from the food samples may not be known until late in the week .
lindsey was a great bartender .
thank you so much fat tuesday 's everywhere !
cheap and decent , but your towers are too far away from each other .
we had tony for our experience , and it was a great time .
crab cakes are the perfect consistency .
the lobster stuffed mushrooms that we ordered were ok .
the staff were great , hardly any kids where we were at .
love , love , love .
my boyfriend got the cat .
imagine if i would have got the cheap one ?
i had zero to drink - zero !
that _num_ star is for hospitality .
best service and experience and would definitely stop by again !
_num_ hurricane with an extra shot .
diana is amazing and knows her stuff .
circo has become my favorite place to dine in recent years .
this is the best [ drink ] deal in vegas , in my opinion !
negative : this is one of the older hotels .
this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed at .
the casino was ok , waitress was rude and never brought my drink .
the care was great and the nurses were friendly and helpful .
wait time on their customer service hot line is outrageously long .
and omg , i was so happy with the results !
rudely again at this point i was off my phone .
wow , the gelato here is amazing !
thanks for the experience of a lifetime !
service is okay , its better than average .
a $ _num_ dollar room ?
i highly recommend the beef empanadas , so good .
did not enjoy the food .
great variety of games , plenty of things for a wide audience .
this is a must go !
the server was great .
nice view of fountain .
no wifi to speak of .
the pillows are nasty .
spent one night there and could n't wait to get out .
do not waste your money on this stupid hotel .
i received sooo many compliments on mine and my daughter 's bouquets !
the management company and maintenance get _num_ star .
car window was broken into in their parking garage .
we were discounted $ _num_ dollars but that seemed like a big joke .
the entire evening was perfect .
excellent food the tapas are amazing , none were bad .
the fries , tuna tartar , and empanadas were a few of my faves .
that means i also know what bad to excellent service is .
it took over _num_ minutes for them to to seat us .
terrible customer service from the large man behind the counter !
the atmosphere was very inviting ... .
will not be coming back .
overall a very cool place to hit away from the strip .
great atmosphere , location , music , staff .
the ac does n't work right .
great black and white cookies and we picked up some pastrami for the road .
i loved my boyfriend 's food at spago .
the gm did n't even apologize .
i 'll definitely go back when in vegas next time !
this place is off the chart good and a great value .
this store used to be my favorite !
i always start with a cap rear and the agnolotti for the table .
terrible rooms and facilities .
and this is just a handful of names who enjoyed this great place .
if you know me , you know i love anything to do with sandwiches .
we wo n't stay here again .
the back near the restroom has narrow hallways , is darker and feels dirty .
played almost all week , nothing .
never had it before and it was very tasty .
really the only good thing was the view , because i did an upgrade .
anyway , bought them , cooked them the same as before but no joy .
good service , great atmosphere .
first room smelled like shit had to change rooms .
he had no idea how to blow dry curly hair .
i went for breakfast and they were making omelette and crepes .
good guac at this place ... spicy salsas too .
they both had a great time and enjoyed playing some games and claw machines .
my go to hotel in vegas .
the bathrooms are horrible though , you ca n't hardly see anything in them .
definitely one of the things that are a must do when in vegas !
i am in a non smoking room but it still smells old and musty .
please , keep it .
always recommend to any guest staying vegas .
great food , great drinks .
i am at a loss on why people like to come here .
the chicken in the chow mein was not edible .
great lunch and the service was excellent as well .
we got the _num_ course wine pairing for an extra $ _num_ each .
but i enjoyed my food very much .
whenever i go to vegas , i always want to eat here .
not leftover from last night , but maybe last week .
the food was excellent too .
you will forever have a place in my heart .
i will never rent anything from a rent a center again .
it was nice that you can program how far the target goes out .
the salmon was n't fresh .
by far my favorite meal in vegas .
because of this attitude you have earned my yelp review .
really that 's what i get told .
it seems to stop there though .
the wine list is very reasonably priced , and the staff is wonderful .
the sandwiches are spot on here .
i heart this place .
please open one closer to me .
i thought the steak fajitas were fine for the price .
he was lucky he got anything at all .
some of them were rude about it .
love it and cant wait to go back to pay them a visit !
do not stay here !
i do n't believe he spoke english .
thank you so much for making my birthday a special one .
it was a big waste of $ _num_ .
get a cool icy drink .
not liking it anymore .
it 's decor is not only very dated but a bit shabby .
they really do a wonderful job making the perfect ring you need !
these bagels even hold up for a few days so order a dozen .
please expand to the phoenix area .
tasty ceviche and yummy sliders .
the menu looked great .
the food in the restaurant is extremely overpriced .
i just wish they had happy hour on the weekends !
wow , amazing staff and owners !
the office has the worse front desk staff and billing ever experienced .
the food and service was great and the prices were reasonable .
really , is this how you run a business ?
clearly that is not work .
the only positive is its at the center of the strip .
till then , it 's for drinks only , if even that .
this place is for midwest tourists on a budget !
for _num_ hot and spicy no lettuce and no mayo !
great place to stay .
placed order online for _num_ pizzas and several orders of wings .
came here last year after my boyfriends sister suggested it .
it 's not worthy .
very tasty duck entree .
this time we had the pepperoni and it was really great !
the wait staff here is on top of their game .
the tapas are fresh , interesting , and some are even a good deal .
family friendly , affordable .
you should probably head to another casino if you want to do some gambling .
went to red lobster last night for my daughters birthday dinner .
this was one of the best chinese dining experiences i 've ever had .
and lastly , no wifi .
i love my mac products and would recommend making a appointment .
first time i was here , was _num_ year ago .
check in didnt take long , dude was ok .
the rooms were okay size but everything in it was just basic .
my family stayed here for _num_ nights when we went to vegas .
i would not stay here again .
it was an amazing atmosphere !
thanks for the flowers lol .
fixtures and lamps and stuff were dirty .
everyone 's food on the table was great .
: ) this is your place !
she looks at me and goes huh ?
if i could give no stars i would .
every casino looks the same to me : slot machines and card tables .
a pleasure from start to finish .
the temperature of the room was either really hot or really cold .
on top of it all , the prices are very reasonable !
not sure if i would try this one again .
spago is moderately priced and is a nice choice for lunch or dinner .
nope , not even remotely .
my tip , do not come here .
i love love love this place !
i love love love this place !
i love love love this place !
bacon wrapped dates - just perfect .
i do n't know why anyone would feel comfortable staying here .
wonderful classic italian delight .
only one pool was open , but several hot tubs were available .
it 's so good !
especially love the one on paradise !
avoid playing slots at this hotel !
even the pickled ginger was flavorless and harsh to eat .
it smelled terrible and was super tacky .
the staff was nice and the rooms great .
the drinks were pretty good too !
but let me tell you , its great fun !
do not waist your time here .
it was perfect to share with a ton of variety .
i still get cravings for their delicious truffle fries !
the ingredients are fresh and the food is delicious .
service was competent and efficient .
no coffee in the room .
well it 's a _num_ star hotel !
told me my room as recently renovated .
every bite was delicious !
the food here was amazing .
what a great restaurant !
and worth it to add shrimp .
it has nice , spacious and updated rooms .
my experience here last week was amazing !
old and tired hotel !
i was afraid to see the lower priced , `` old '' rooms .
i just ca n't quite get past the kobe burger thing .
he rudely said ok and left me standing there .
wow - why is there a walgreen 's on the strip ?
i would even prefer chuck e. cheese .
they have horrible cell phone reception .
just take your time and enjoy .
i love the piano bar , its a blast .
never ever coming here again .
the food was flavorful , creative and fun .
those _num_ dishes are amazing and are worth any drive to enjoy them !
would you believe they moved someone into the mildew room later that night ?
the decor is old and ugly in the hallways and the rooms .
i maybe would have given _num_ stars if it were n't for this .
all in all , a great experience .
from october _num_ to _num_ , _num_ , i stayed at excalibur .
there was no fresh fruit or water in the locker room .
omg so much fun !
great instructor , great for family .
great date place , great place to hang with friends .
the atmosphere is very nice with a live jazz group playing background music .
the front desk staff literally has no business being in customer service .
i really appreciate her being there `` in my hour of need '' .
everything looks dirty except the chapel , again the only highlight .
safe clean and professional .
best tapas place i 've been to .
the good : damn good service , damn good food .
love , love love !
it is inside the venetian .
ahh , fat tuesday ... the best way to start your day in vegas .
i went back to registration and asked to move up even just one level .
of course they denied the whole thing .
the service was excellent as well .
nice `` outdoor '' seating .
we went on a tuesday night and it was packed !
the food was decent , i just could n't stand the service .
i 'm sorry , but , that 's bad customer service .
their sparkling sangria is the best !
the place has a very unpleasant feel to it maybe because of the location .
the service was also excellent , thank you mike .
the shrimp fried rice was the smell .
kalbi was dry and really stringy .
if you love new york city bagels than you will love the bagels here .
was n't happy with what i picked up at all .
everything looked so real , definitely worth every penny !
extremely friendly and patient .
everything is clearly reheated and none of that was even done well .
drinks were n't overpriced , and it had a great atmosphere .
only went once and was not really impressed enough to try it again .
walked by and got the aroma of pizza !
the service was impeccable and kept everyones drink full and kept the food coming .
that i found it that the cheese was $ _num_ .
we had such a terrific shopping experience at this location !
the service was rushed , the food was bland and expensive .
no place to sit to eat .
great atmosphere ... great meal ... there is something for everybody !
drinks were great too .

they are very comfortable and clean .
i highly recommend this place .
worse customer service , specially in the cafe .

there were a few who were very far off .
we only used the room to shower and sleep .
room service did not clean our room till _num_ every day .
close , but does n't quite make the mark .
we were tired and trying to just get into our room .
we were tired and trying to just get into our room .
the apple support crew was nice and supper helpful .
the bathroom was extremely ridiculous ; it was something i have never seen before .
they never cleaned the rest room from the last guest .
great location but a smokey and old casino .
i never stayed at the harrahs , and i never will !
i stayed at harrah 's the past week and it sucked .
here _num_ minutes and already had to call maintenance .
leave sushi to the japanese .
great customer service and awesome food !
great casino , and lots of other fun stuff going on as well .
other than that , good for what you pay !
hard to get service while i was playing video poker .
i gave the other store a four star review ( night and day ) .
she made our special event even more special .
i will return here every time i go to vegas .
next trip already planned - firefly i 'll see you soon !
thanks for a great time vegas !
located right next to ruth chris .
they were warm and so good !
the resort fee is a total scam .
the best nike store there is .
the margarita was good .
the hotel itself is old and not clean .
i love this walgreens .
a friend chose spago .
great place and atmosphere .
not very big , but they do the trick .
no coffee maker in room .
we came with a big group and the service was great .
all around , a great time .
our server danielle was fun and terrific and made the whole experience memorable .
then we go to the pool , and there are no towels ready .
rude employees & bad customer service !
it was so small , it was like a child 's bedroom .
first , someone needs to check this car wash place out for insurance fraud .
a great and unique place !
there is no coffee maker !
the aroma of stale spilled beer .
happy hour is the best time to go !
and that person had the nerve to tell me i was being rude .
this is the spot !
i also liked the mussels .
the next thing why i do n't like this hotel are the rooms .
it is `` a must '' if you like tapas !
we stopped here for lunch , and it was great .
the cajun fries are just fries tossed in buffalo sauce .
the underground parking lot sucks and there 's about _num_ spots near the elevator .
first strike , out of fat fries .
always accommodating to last minute changes to my reservations .
wo n't be returning .
_num_ queen beds instead of one king !
their service and quality were just poor all around .
richard our server was great , very attentive and made sure we were good .
this place is incredible !
i had to travel different floors just to get _num_ - _num_ ice cubes .
we devoured our food !
although they have good customer service , they seem lost .
i ordered _num_ chicken sandwiches , poor choice and crazy expensive !
i personally had to wait _num_ hours to get to the desk .
excellent service , wine , ambiance and food .
every time we visit the forum , we will always stop by this place .

the service is always fantastic they are very attentive and friendly .
our server cody did an amazing job .
to top it all off , chef came out to meet us !
dinner was great too !
casino is very smokey and the air does n't seem to be filtered .
go here to ruin your vacation ... .
it was amazing ... .
later found out it is a korean owned sushi restaurant .
we will definitely be coming back .
the tastes were unremarkable .
they work quickly and the price is reasonable , and the material holds up .
then lost my keys for my car .
very interactive and friendly nice atmosphere and loved the other guest !
an extra shot , yes please !
it was a blast !
the first yellow cab driver was nice , not too overly friendly or chatty .
we will not be coming back to stay , ever .
it was so good that i ordered one for myself .
but the meat ... mushrooms and onions were really really under seasoned .
there were _num_ young guys getting people 's bags .
most of all , it is good .
make sure you know there is $ _num_ resort fees per day !
i came in and got two bagels on my lunch hour .
i 'll stay downtown where my business is appreciated .
loved the cilantro rice !
eight days in this place was more than i will ever do again .
did n't taste right , and now i 'm suffering for it .
the first thing i noticed was the smell .
we definitely recommend this restaurant !
there were parts disconnected and the filter needed to be changed .
i would n't even go inside later to get to the tram quicker .
i would n't even go inside later to get to the tram quicker .
you feel very prepared and safe .
then they asked me if i was japanese and i told them yes .
but it is worth it .
it was delicious ( a little greasy ) and came with olives .
never use this lady 's floral shop .
we got a pitcher of mojitos , and they were wonderful !
this place was great !
to get blankets we had to get approval again from the manager .
i would recommend signing up for the rewards membership if you are an adult !
all the food is fresh i only wish i could eat more .
what a waste of $ _num_ .
the view she went on and on about , was not so great .
top notch for me once again .
well it was just really insulting to me , he does n't know me .
the hotel is very old and smelly .
bad service equals no tip !
poor excuse for philly cheese steak sandwich .
but it was pretty sweet and fruity .
on the whole , this place is just meh .
so we get up , open the hall door and here 's nothing .
it was a horrible experience do not stay here !
the total with tax was $ _num_ .
if you value your life do not stay here !
stayed here for a few nights while in vegas waiting for another hotel .
we walked in and i swear i rented a room at a motel _num_ .
the pool was also just ok .
the casino is outdated and lacking in the slot machine area .
this girl was pretty condescending , rude and no help .
i stayed here because i was forced to and i would never come back .
overall experience was good .
this place is amazing !
this place is amazing !
this place is amazing !
this place is amazing !
this place is very good .
how things can change for the worse .
overall , a great place with excellent food and a great staff .
_num_ stars for this location , _num_ stars for other locations .
the staff has been caring and professional .
i mentioned the cigarette butt in the hall as well .
the wait staff is efficient and friendly .
my boyfriend 's beef tenderloin was huge and juicy .
even the super expensive ones are fun for window shopping .
the guy said that it was confusing directions which was why .
$ _num_ for _num_ people to have burgers and fries is quite steep .
we always pull the dry clean only comforter off the bed first thing .
you really do n't want to stop here .
so i ca n't really complain .
this is now the 3rd time i 've come to firefly .
this is the 1st & last excalibur experience for us .
next time i 'm in town i 'll definitely make another stop .
i finally went and was disappointed beyond belief .
the monorail is the perfect means of transportation for anyone visiting las vegas .
ask the server what is fresh , and you 'll get an honest answer .
from the host to the bar keeps to the servers and everyone in between .
place was really dirty like everyone had told me .
i would definitely recommend this buffet to families and even couples .
great customer service from danielle !
took a long time but lamb was truly amazing !
the pizza is really good !
got the lobster salad , clean and crisp .
its right next to ross , sometimes i like going shopping .
there goes _num_ star .

i highly recommend this place to all moms looking for a daycare .
ah , this is the way to do it !
bahama breeze is amazing for happy hour !
he is funny and attentive , but also knowledgeable .
drove by to check out their inventory .
this is one of the best margaritas i 've every had .
my favorite mexican restaurant ever .

really enjoyed the atmosphere , we had seats right next to the canal .
they made no attempt to make the situation right .
eh it was n't the best .
unique beer on tap .
they booked us a private room and the service was very helpful and friendly .
just no reason to ever go back .
the service was great and it was packed !
tl ; dr : excellent customer service and of course , delicious chocolate .
the pizza here is awesome .

worst buffet and old building nothing else to say u probably got the point !
i could not fall asleep and woke up often .
went here to eat with my husband and two friends .
good for half off drinks for happy hour !
if you 've got kids , it 's probably ok .
i stayed at this hotel with my bf just last week .
i ask the waiter and he says the a/c has failed .
i do not recommend .
i had the pasta and it was delicious .
he represented the food and company very well .
if i was n't so hungry is leave this place .
prices seem to be a little high for the work they 're doing .
the walls are paper thin , this place smells like heavy smoke !
the best part is going to the bakery afterwards and getting their delicious pastries !
another new thing they started was _num_ day move out notice .
no mention of this when i booked slow service if any at all .
no mention of this when i booked slow service if any at all .
the good thing about their buffet is u serve ur own drinks .
i 've eaten here a handful of times and it 's really good .
first , the _num_ hosts ( why do you need _num_ hosts ? )
we had a _num_ rooms suite and really enjoyed our stay here .
only three of the ticket counters were open .
our waitress ( whose name i forgot ) was delightful and very accommodating .
perfect for a quick to go meal on the way to the grand canyon .
they were fast and efficient and did a wonderful job of treating her .
love the ambience and lively caribbean music .
spend a little extra money and go stay somewhere better .
charming place , good menu variety , worth the cab fare .
just thankful u did n't gave younger kids !
the sake was one of the best we 've ever had .
highly inconvenient and expensive for shoddy work .
will definitely be going back !
the seating was very small .
he looked at me like i was lying .
this review is for the restaurant week _num_ prix fixe menu .
but it was n't even properly cleaned !
food here was very good hence the _num_ stars .
decent selection of snacks and wine .
this will probably be the only purchase we make with this company !
cool , chill , island theme restaurant with very friendly servers .
but it was well worth the $ _num_ .
never again harrahs , never !
you ca n't even pay for wi-fi in the rooms .
loved the food and service .
jamaican jerk chicken delicious !
never again will i stay here .
ingredients were very fresh and well presented .
when i came back at 8pm , our room was not cleaned .
but someone out there stole my purse and my wallet in it .
big fan of wolfgang - he knows what people like and want to eat .
simple order of spicy chicken nuggets and a small chili .
love lucky brand and love getting deals even more .
no i do n't want to see carrot top !
i paid $ _num_ for _num_ .
all to find out it was a mistake both times .
i ordered the mahi mahi dish and it was excellent !
i was pretty surprised how much i enjoyed it .
everything that could go wrong with a room went wrong !
i called , `` yes , there is a technical problem .
ok , i am of two minds on this place .
no veggie anything at the grill and fox on every tv .
loved every sip of it , will keep my cup for refills !
went here with my sister today to get a mani , loved this place !
$ _num_ kids grilled cheese and fries - better than the steak .
the food is not very good , no seafood , and not really tasty .
our room smelled like old moist !
service was great - thanks brooke !
aaron rocked our mojito world !
everything is located near here and has a good , reasonably priced buffet restaurant .
the pizza hut which is n't apart of hotel undercooked my pizza .
the martinis were very nice as well .
will make it back next time in town .
good food and drinks .
the safe also was n't working .
pluses ... cheap prices on rooms .
a clean and safe ride , also very efficient .
the food at this place is awesome !
so after asshole leaves , me and my dad left the room shortly after .
the food was incredible .
the food was incredible .
every worker was engaged with customers and having fun with their job .
husband still not getting his meal .
the room was so dirty that we couldnt breathe after sleeping .
- one of the best pastas i 've had .
marcus was our waiter and made our first experience wonderful .
this is my favorite restaurant in las vegas for an elegant meal .
i hate shopping when there is too much noise .
i will not be giving out recommendations for your company .
i just honestly never had someone say no n not try n help .
brooke is an amazing mac pro .
give it a try !
nothing had been done at all during this period of time .
they lacked a lot of foods and desserts most buffets have .
that , she was not .
the service just sucks .
the _num_ was good .
great food and great prices .
best way to get around in las vegas if you 're watching your budget .
the chicken arrived , and it was good .
i tried to pull the water temperature handle tight and this did n't work .
this company is spectacular .
good food good service .
we loved this to take us up and down the strip .
really a fun place with great tasting tapas !
thought this one would be decent ... wrong !
the toro from the sushi menu was the best i have ever had .
great shops , similar to a good mall .
they did n't even warn me ahead of time the condition of the studio .
do n't be fooled !
every bite more impressive than the last .
this is the worst worst place ever !
called to resolve the problem .
the oysters were fantastically fresh .
unfortunately the place is a dump .
the windows were so dirty it was honestly hard to see out them .
spago is my new home away from home .
can i tell you how totally disappointed i was in my stay ?
dirty water does n't bother me so much as the smell .
but this place is definitely a zero in my book .
this is one of my favorite restaurants in vegas .
this is one of my favorite restaurants in vegas .
this is one of my favorite restaurants in vegas .
after the first one i just thought whatever .
our server would n't take our order without rolling her eyes .
i ca n't wait until i come back so i can eat here again !
this tour is a great idea for an activity to do while in vegas .
fun views , neat ride .
another comped room so we gave it a try twice .
alot of trash walking around if ya know what i mean .
yummm i 'll be back !
the room is very dated .
rude and not helpful at all .
the variety of flavors is wonderful .
absolutely great food and awesome bar tenders .
truly recommend , you wo n't regret it !
the food was bland and uninspired .
worst experience of my life .
a sure way to get your buzz going , especially with the extra shot .
the drinks were well done for a happy hour , and totally acceptable .
i 'm sorry = i do n't care .
i absolutely insist you try fat tuesday 's .
a week ago jessica agreed to refund me _num_ dollars .
we loved this place totally !
tv was ok , though for some reason the sound kept going out .
it 's a hip place with a good vibe and interesting people .
stuffed dates were also very good .
this mall could be in any city in the country .
the casino reeks of smoke .
we did n't use room service so i do n't know about that .
the mgm resorts company has squeezed its last nickel out of me .
and , i lost here .
does the job , especially in the summer time .
weird thought , tastes yuck .
i highly recommend spago and encourage you to get the tasting menu .
the monorail was my best friend while in vegas .
i will definitely eat here again next time i 'm in sin city .
this place is great and best prices in the valley .
our waiter was very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu .
basically this was a motel _num_ .
a caprese salad with a wonderful variety of tomatoes ... delish !
the tapas are decent , but i 'd come here again for the drinks !
a million flavors , natural vibrant taste .
anyway , we stayed at tower _num_ and the walls were thin .
everything down to the service , and bread were fantastic !
overall this is an excellent place for bagels and breakfast .
location is the only sketchy part but it is still worth it !
service is ok , i ca n't say is great .
it 's all complete crap !
i sent it back and they replaced it .
again bad food service management .
this is really fun .
if i could give it a zero i would .
the sangria is the best i have ever had .
someone 's vomit was on the hallway outside the elevator for the whole night .
the bed in comfy though , so that 's a plus .
as for food , almost everything we got was delicious .
the asparagus was cooked well with a good char but no spice at all .
i will be back !
i will be back !
i checked and yes it did not move .
i checked and yes it did not move .
harrah 's will always be tops on my places to stay .
i will definitely be back next year .
food was good , nothing to write home about .
nasty food and service .
not a lot of flavor besides the soy sauce and wasabi i used .
yeah , no never again will i stay here .
i was given a horrible customer service .
a great , inexpensive , off the strip dining choice for spanish tapas .
the next day i went down and requested my room change .
secondly , the parking is awful .
love the stuffed peppers !
the cleaning ladies were cool and accommodating , no complaints there .
i do n't know why , it just felt that way .
highly recommended this restaurant .
my advice is to get your room here and expect to party elsewhere .
the salad was so salty that it was hard to finish .
mine was overly salty .
worst hotel on the strip .
hotel was fine but parking was horrible !
the food here is great .
great place to stay and gamble !
love the tapas experience .
always excellent meals and great wine selection .
i was told the bloody mary was spicy and tasty .
it is definitely my favorite place to hang out after work with friends .
the worst was the food court .
trash cans not empty often enough .
well , that and chocolate , of course .
only go to the buffet if you like macaroni salad and little night life .
this is one of the original vegas nail shops .
they have classic mexican that taste great .
excellent food and service !
the shrimp tempura was good as well .
my boyfriend and i were very annoyed by them .
a great vegas find !
picked this treasure with unassuming front for my husband 's birthday based on reviews .
the stations and trains are very clean !
lets just say it was pure disappointment .
the person helping us out was super patient and accommodating to what we wanted .
katie was so patient and fun .
came here for breakfast and had a very good meal .
do not go to this place !
worst place i have ever stayed at .
`` terrible service and business , will never come back .
fun atmosphere and pretty good food too .
i 'm never coming here again .
we ordered our favorite dishes .
excalibur hotel , are you kidding me ?
also , their props need to be updated because some are old and worn .
they could use an extensive upgrade .
they could use an extensive upgrade .
one of our favorite spots in vegas !
really good experience of shopping anything you wan na try little better quality .
when i travel for work , i travel cheap .
also has some lower priced dining options .
now it seems outdated .
larry 's meats not owned by larry anymore and it shows .
this could be lived with if the units were not so loud .
nice filipino assistant that was easy on the eyes .
truly a hangover killer .
this business is amazing and is not your typical jewelry store .
i hate they charge for wifi .
this was not worth the money .
thank you all so much .
( short black hair , hispanic , long unprofessional black nails ) .
: ) ) amazing drinks !
oh by the way , her name is carrie .
add the chicken on it , very good as well .
live singer performers on the weekend too .
amazing food , the tuna tartar and stuffed mushrooms in particular .
i 'd come back for drinks since the setting is so great .
motel _num_ with a casino attached .
not enough parking , no parking for guests .
why are they so salty ?
if i could have rated this _num_ stars , i would have !
i brought my husband here for a date and boy did we enjoy ourselves .
_num_ card poker was also fun .
i loved loved loved the little brie sandwiches with the tomato soup .
needless to say that all changed upon our arrival .
we decided on bahama breeze , and it was great !
great atmosphere , great service , great food .
it 's fun holding it sharing with friends .
_num_ minutes later , we got checked in .
plus , they have a nice malbec on the menu at a nice price .
it was insane , man .
stay clear of this denny 's its so not worth it.
there was no fire but that alarm is loud as all heck .
could be worse , but we wo n't stay here again .
the receptionists at check-in were rude .
the food is outstanding !
the food is outstanding !
fabulous food , fabulous service and fabulous ambiance .
good store with average selection .
our pilot alexander was very informative and enthusiastic tour guide .
it was truly disgusting .
i only went because everyone says they have awesome apple fritters .
it 's big enough to share and deliciously light and fluffy .
no one said `` oh that sucks i 'm sorry . ''
i tasted no salt at all .
excellent and efficient service on wonderful products .
i did n't like it.
so i got ta win it again ( and i do ) .
well no fridge and to get one you pay _num_ per night with tax .
the air conditioning worked very well which is important in the las vegas weather .
it is my fav !
this is not a gluten free friendly place .
wifi is there , but hella hard to connect to .
they 're my new favorite jeans !
not at this store .
definitely will be back next time we are in town !
the entire table had a taste and would n't eat the remaining .
sofa bed was hard .
circus circus is the place to go if you want cheap & family friendly !
the security guy said someone opened our door _num_ times use the key card !
the casino floor was a bit depressing and so were the people playing there .
all in all nothing _num_ or _num_ star worthy .
$ _num_ for the smaller burger , fries , and a soda is outrageous .
we always get the lemon chicken which is the best ever and fried rice .
overall its an amazing place good for kids and adults .
it was a perfect stay .
had a great time this year .
i had the wild mushroom enchilada which was super tasty !
the guys here worked efficiently .
but so worth it .
here on vacation and will definitely come back again !
everything seems to smell like smoke .
food : the food was great .
casino only - fun place ; great atmosphere .
alize failed to deliver on both .
it 's a real vacation when you stay at a hotel !
it 's such an amazing reminder of that day !
they do n't know what to do if you have a gluten allergy .
first off they changed the menu but not for the better .
stay away , they do not deserve your money .
the tapas are amazing .
they really treat you well .
zero stars , dont even go there .
purchased toys online for pickup at this location .
cheap hotel on the strip with an embarrassing atmosphere ( circus ?
we really like this place .
and would be ready soon , she would call us .
this is the only place that does not let you order half rolls .
cheese , i had onion & mushrooms were n't cooked !
the humans enjoyed the food , but it was standard bar food .
the silver lining ... the valet guy was super nice .
i am not comparing this budget hotel to those .
i am not comparing this budget hotel to those .
wanted to get a quick bite and stopped by this place .
we quit staying here _num_ _num_ years ago .
the quality of service we received was great .
my cousin 's looked gorgeous too !
every person made me feel like i was wasting their time .
their sangria is decent as well .
the view was nice and the room was clean .
the staff was great !
great variety for the wine list with lots of affordable options .
first of all , they now stop serving breakfast at 11am .
the staff is nothing to speak of .
tip ... avoid room _num_ on any floor .
this is my absolute favorite restaurant !
take your car elsewhere !
see you guys next year !
i highly recommend more people do this !
my favorite tapas are the stuffed dates and the warm spinach salad .
staying in this hotel was the worst experience we had .
also a great spot for people watching !
circus circus is cheaper and they actually have wi-fi there !
the room prices are fantastic , and you get large rooms .
they eventually gave me a new room and it was fine .
it had not been cleaned at all either .
the exhibit is probably fine , i would n't know .
there 's a very diverse drink menu for anyone 's needs .
party of _num_ , over _num_ hours .
thanks for a great experience .
it 's a great photo opportunity with wax figures of today 's hottest stars .
no one did anything .
i 've stayed here twice and that amount of times was too many .
a great experience all around .
this hotel was n't ready for the amount of guests that it booked .
the hotel reeks of smoke , unlike any other we visited .
also , picked up _num_ plastic cups from the bottom of the pool .
at the end of the transaction she gives me the ten dollars off anyway .
thank you for using yelp .
sadly , they sell an overpriced product .
they send a security guard up and tell my best friend compliments from downstairs .
during the piercing , i passed out ( no idea why ) .
of course there were n't any seats at this point .
i probably wo n't come back here again unless i 'm short on time .
good for a date or special occasion , or for mildly adventurous foodies .
night crew sitting around too lazy to work .
and yes i would recommend a reservation , this place was pretty packed .
my mom had a sangria , which was very nice .
the sales ladies were so friendly and helpful .
staff was very friendly .
it was so much fun !
i would n't stay here again if you paid for my room .
you can tell that the ingredients are fresh , and the service was fantastic .
paid $ _num_ for one drink , really ?
the food here is really bad .
the concept is great .
the flavor of every dish was spectacular and we 'll presented !
the room was marvelous !
_num_ minutes after that the dr entered .
besides that , this place sucks .
um , well worth it .
no employee or manager once apologized for their screw up .
would totally recommend to a friend !
the hotel bar is a dick 's last resort .
the staff was also super friendly and attentive .
have fun here and keep yelping !
make sure you check out the cheese plate !
on the side , i ordered 1/2 slab or ribs which was _num_ dollars !
overall the experience was great and i 'd go back .
he 's hooked now too !
i was able to use my visa , no problem !
her response of `` we never change the blankets '' was less than comforting .
the pool has no shade unless you pay for it .
free wifi is awesome , nice vending machines , and their ac actually works !
classic , one of the best overall vegas dining experiences .
loved the ceviche , chorizo clam , and stuffed dates was also pretty interesting .
this particular location is weird .
do n't expect anything super fancy though .
it 's become a tradition to get a _num_ octane with an extra shot .
if you 're booking a room , there are better options in vegas .
it is basically a money trap .
he 's gon na deliver our baby and we 're very happy with him .
worst experience ever ordered a ham and cheese hoagie and got a philly steak .
my friend and i recently went to vegas for _num_ days .
could n't sleep at night and was very uncomfortable .
great lox , cookies , cream cheeses and of course , bagels .
perhaps other menu items are edible but their veggie stromboli is disgusting .
the lobby and casino were musty and outdated .
seriously tender and delicious .
( fourth floor , room _num_ ) .
ah well , it happens .
i mean everything from the parking garage , elevators , walls etc .
service was great , and food was tastefully prepared and served timely .
hands down has to be the worst hotel on the strip .
if that was n't our first bad sign .
everything in the room is beat up , old and/or stained .
oh , and the car was on empty .
perfect for lunch or earlier dinner .
bartenders and the overall bar experience is great !
that took about _num_ minutes as my phone was dying .
the casino is old , dark , dingy and not very lucky !
the front desk girl was also very rude .
excellent small plates , especially for a late night meal .
slammed our waters down on the table .
glad the server took it off our bill .
staff is friendly and trained well so the wait is usually minimal .
my favorite flavor is the butter pecan .
im not a limo stupid lady .
i think this was one of the reasons we got sick .
needless to say , i changed my email .
- this place just sucked .
the worst dish of the evening - the chicken dish .
waitresses all look like they rolled out of bed and unhappy .
try the flautas and sangria , so good .
the outdoor seating gives it a romantic , elegant atmosphere .
great wine selection , and the sommelier is top notch .
while waiting for rest of party , _num_ of us sat in the bar .
this is a sorry excuse for a hotel .
they said no and i left and went to caesars .
i will never stay here again _num_ main reasons .
i used to stay here relatively often because they often send me free rooms .
i wish i could review the hotel separate from the staff .
this is the worst place you can get your pizza .
very large & nice selection .
this hotel does n't deserve one star either .
the service was excellent .
the service was excellent .
it turns out that we hit the jackpot !
i absolutely hated this restaurant .
what a horrible experience !
chopped salad was a good start .
the bartender was great .
service was slow but i 'm thinking maybe it 's relaxing and not slow .
after he rushed through my husband sandwich , he went on break .
what ... the ... fuck ?
great prices , but it 's cash only .
mushroom soup and mushroom ravioli is amazing !
so we got the monorail from harrahs back to mgm .
a hidden gem that 's definitely worth leaving the strip .
get one walk around and have fun .
just a good place to have a nice dinner .
they have the best alcoholic beverages ever !
and such vintage feeling as well .
give your business to people who want to be helpful , not these characters .
i loved this place !
horrible service and run business .
unfortunately this mall has gone downhill over the past few years .
my brother got impatient so we left .
then when it was time for the gifts ; it was such a fraud .
great tapas , good service , amazing drinks and decent prices for lv .
yes , it 's that bad .
there 's at least _num_ shopping malls in each city .
she could n't explain it .
it 's soooo good , so good once it touches your lips .
its such a shame everytime ive called horrible experience .
also , no fridge !
he just said that this was not his problem .
our food was pretty good .
we love love that there are two macy 's in this mall .
great place to dine !
i stayed here for a work trip the second time in _num_ months .
they came looking beautiful fresh and delivered on time .
definitely one of the best in vegas .
i had signed in online first and got right in .
in fact , why would even think like that ?
it is a cool place .
the casino is flat out dirty .
it was nothing special .
we shared the empanadas ( good ) and flautas ( spectacular ) .
it was one of the best pizzas i 've ever tried .
one of the things that i really enjoy is the town square .
i found the check-in counters & it was quite confusing .
the staff is pleasant and courteous and we 've never had an issue here .
best prices for a great hotel .
room smells , ugly view , for _num_ for two nights ?
save some extra cash and go elsewhere .
_num_ star is all that i can say .
they really make the sale go smoothly here , and i really appreciated it .
did not eat and would not make a special trip for happy hour again .
the beds are hard and very uncomfortable .
the bacon wrapped dates are pure heaven .
the service was good , the food was good and the atmosphere was nice .
fortunately i did n't see him cooking my food , so i was okay .
tournament of kings show sucked .
i loved almost everything that was served .
check in was terrible , super long slow line .
oh , yeah , no bath tub .
even the cooked foods like the mini beef steak was off somehow .
the happy hour specials are pretty good .
it needs renovations and a better cleaning crew .
cars are super clean and it 's way cheaper than a taxi .
( we hated this hotel .
i gave this place _num_ star because of the materials they stock .
very crowded , popular and noisy but worth it .
the most amazing place i have eaten at .
super awesome experience and surprise for my bachelor day events .
shower was n't even hot one morning , and leaked .
nice atmosphere & service .
the rice and beans were very good too !
the carpets are stained , the ceilings are low , not very inviting .
worst hotel in las vegas .
the apple store is great !
i love the crowd here and the atmosphere .
just got the worst customer service ever !
i 'm a huge fan of seafood pasta and this one was divine .
love this place been going for years and it 's always consistent .
lovely atmosphere as well .
my wife pretty much buys all her makeup from mac .
it was not extra tasty or extra large .
our room also had a weird smell to it .
i love this place , great food with nice decor .
the worst service i 've have ever experienced tonight going through the drive through .
customer service _num_ stars .
the mojitos are delicious too and come by the pitcher if you want .
dino we wish you many more successful years in business !
this place is hands down amazing !
the staff wee quite friendly .
drinks were excellent as well .
it had not been touched !
lines to check in and check out were long .
i paid $ _num_ buck plus tax wtf step it up a notch .
i won nearly a grand on slots alone !
that 's horrible service .
during the wait it was difficult to get coffee fill up .
but apparently , he is n't paid to listen .
the place wasnt clean , the service was gross .
did i mention that this was after work and i was in my uniform ?
the appetizers were great and so were our dishes .
i said , `` wtf , ok the computer messed up ! ''
like everything in vegas , its big .
they were thin and worn out !
in total i was in there for _num_ min .
do not stay at here .
the prices are a little cheaper , but the food is still wonderful .
everything we tried was awesome , and pretty economical .
the figures were life like , but this is no museum .
didnt even care to wipe it down .
i think this is probably the finest floral service in las vegas .
stayed here for a `` cheap '' alternative while visiting for a bachelorette party .
the duck breast was nearly white it was so over cooked .
best tapas in vegas .
businesses are trying hard .
cheesecake and creme brle were executed extremely well .
went with a good friend of mine who has been coming here for years .
they just would n't stop .
was starving so decided to try it out .
it 's a must in vegas .
buffet was a joke , even for a pretty low price for breakfast .
a wide variety of choices to choose from .
overall , it 's a great restaurant .
the bathroom sink and floor were covered in hair .
usually , the rates are cheaper if you stay on weekdays .
advice : spend the extra money and skip the castle .
i was so angry that i did n't bother .
love the _num_ day passes !
great drinks and service .
`` i do n't live here , i live in seattle . ''
i love the midway !
has to be one of the worst place for a trade show .
i hate this place .
this is not what i expected for an _num_ plus tax sandwich .
we liked it so much we went back again the next evening for dinner .
the bathrooms are disgusting with piss everywhere and the whole place is just filthy .
will definitely try this again on my next trip to vegas !
smooth atmosphere , reasonably priced , and the food is great .
just the right portion size .
casual , eclectic atmosphere makes it comfortable for anybody .
lady asked me where my cup is .
he was consistently refilling and double checking that we were doing good .
my favorite is strawberry and hurricane .
i am a fan of this place !
overall , i expected a lot more from this hotel .
the place looked very nice and very trendy .
the customer service is bad .
because the first one was _num_ lb bigger .
the waiting staff was very friendly and very quick in their service .
worst stay at a las vegas hotel so far .
the pay outs are n't bad and the adventure dome is really fun !
potatoes and cabbage out of season , perhaps .
basically what it comes down to is do n't stay here .
another suspicious thing occurred at this hotel .
super great location and clean rooms !
i will give las vegas wan na be 's some credit .
but no worries i am here for the shrimp .
the wait time while in the office is unacceptable .
overall a nice place to stay while u in vegas .
the rooms are nice , and the beds are comfortable as well .
did not like service at all .
my boyfriend had the spaghetti and he loved it as well .
we were very happy , we did n't have a crowd to fight through .
this is a budget friendly hotel .
but im still a fan .
awesome food and drinks .
the car wash itself was shabby at best .
the car wash itself was shabby at best .
its like being at the circus and all the employees are extra nice .
the food and atmosphere is great .
the waiter was very funny and nice .
went above and beyond to make sure i looked hot and flawless .
this was the worse hotel i 've stayed at in los vegas .
this is a very good jewish style deli .
this was a great start to a perfect dinner .
it smells more like dust and smoke than most of the other hotels .
lets do it again !
the atmosphere was cool , but maybe i 'm not a spanish cuisine person ?
i highly recommend this place for a quick bite to eat for lunch .
feel sorry for the employees .
them people that works there do n't know how to greet customers properly .
i 'm in tower _num_ which is suppose to be the better tower .
the staff seemed burned out , and not to care about good customer service .
overall , this place is fantastic .
went back to the room around 6:30 in the morning and slept .
this is the second time this happened , first time to complain .
so we went expecting good food , good drinks and good prices .
they really need to give this hotel a makeover .
the rooms sport terrible lighting and there is no free wi-fi .
a favorite of mine .
everything came out delicious and very quick .
i was pleasantly surprised .
will not return again and will not recommend anyone else either .
i went upstairs to bay watch watch repair , he charged me $ _num_ .
some of the best eats i have had .
in every store i visited , rude customers and rude employees .
then tried charging me $ _num_ !
ca n't beat the _num_ $ happy hour margaritas .
but then it was time to get change from the machine .
the pizza was good but not great .
we love every course !
definitely coming back for more !
had the shrimp linguine which was delicious too .
it was a nightmare .
the price is right and the room was clean .
worst service ever here !
i do n't remember what flavor it was exactly ... just fruity and delicious .
and as an added peeve , the bathroom light is n't very great .
i now remember why i have n't been here for a couple years .
to top it all the service was great !
i love the mix and match the flavors .
room : at same level or below a motel _num_ .
wow , wow , wow !
the mardi gras tower needs an update badly .
old , dingy , better places to stay .
i mean its cheap , its fun , and its good !
for rolling my luggage _num_ feet ?
pretty much cleaned my plate .
nothing in the room is updated , and there is poop on our window !
worst place in town by far !
the pool is the worst i have seen in vegas .
but this never happened .
for this `` neighborhood '' that is a deal !
got back around _num_ pm no one had fixed the window .
-- -- -the hotel itself was also disgusting !
the iron was not cleaned and had old , cold water still in it .
it was _num_ pm by the time my name issue was resolved .
you can park and fly for _num_ dollars !
the bedding was not comfortable , really nothing special about this place whatsoever .
i know to us our brother is slow , but come on !
the tables and the dealers were worn out and not in a good way .
the hotel is not a luxury hotel , but is clean and nice .
sorry to bother you sir .
great fun and super safe .
of course the hot tea we have to beg for was not included .
rooms in the resort tower are dated , at best .
it had circus performances , karaoke , the amusement park , etc .
his service was worse than food court on the street .
it was still good and nicely cold .
the filet sliders are beyond awesome !
the toilet runs all night .
i 'm sure she had better things to do ... not a bad experience .
but damn - i love this store and the forum shops .
this place is definitely one of my favorite places to eat in vegas .
next month you pay $ _num_ for water and $ _num_ for lights !
the rooms are big and comfortable .
the two stars are based on the food only , which was amazing .
the philly was surprisingly dry and lacking flavor .
we will definitely go back and stay there again !
food was ok and service was really bad .
i thought i was inside !
i highly recommend the quesadilla .
great hours , the staff is very helpful and patrons are friendly .
this place needs to be torn down .
the customer service was terrible .
i got it with pastrami and loved it .
it really is n't much .
every time with positive feedback .
great affordable option in the venetian .
the food is incredibly good and fresh .
i wanted to like this place , but i was disappointed .
i would give this hotel a zero if i could .
perfectly executed and delicious .
this place was a huge hit for our party of _num_ .
the bathrooms are gross .
arrived here at 6:30 am on sunday morning .
just do n't expect too much .
definitely got me toasted .
the staff was great .
the staff was great .
it 's truly the best one .
it is wide open and nicely decorated .
went to the firefly restaurant based upon their menu .
the place needs a desperate new coat of paint on the outside .
but apparently excalibur can not be bothered .
extremely slow check in .
so flavorful , the ambiance was just perfect , and the staff was wonderful .
the service is excellent we had a wonderful experience .
definitely a must at vegas !
that typically goes for $ _num_ a night .
this place is a must if you 're heading out to vegas .
i 'll definitely be coming back .
we dont plan to eat in that place again for a long time anyway !
then why was the check-out sign placed there ?
it was a very nice place .
they had a supervisor come out and he helped us out immensely .
do n't believe their advertisement of `` free '' wireless .
lol i totally recommend .
btw , the buffet sucks .
every last thing we ordered was interesting and amazing .
i felt like a number , not a customer .
great food we always get two bowls of pork adobo .
_num_ minute wait is unacceptable .
one of my favorite restaurants in las vegas .
the ugly : the hotel is dated and needs a major facelift .
the angry chicken was okay ... could have been better .
i actually tend to really like harrah 's casinos .
this place was pretty good !
i was in heaven !
my biggest complaint was our hotel room key cards would not work !
i wo n't be back .
this is a really crappy hotel with really crappy customer service .
it took forever to get our bags though .
i eat here about three or four times a year , breakfast and lunch .
to top it off they make a good mojito .
as a local , one of my favorite places to go .
the bathrooms were decent but i 've seen nicer showers at motel _num_ .
remind me to never walk through there again !
the slot manager gets props for having some newer games , however .
this place is actually really nice .
it stinks of raw sewage and the bathrooms are awful !
sangria but enjoyed a number of delights .
comparable to a junior suite at one of the casinos .
i recommend having the tiramisu gelato , which is the best i 've had .
food was mostly very tasty and also very affordable .
very happy with the quality of the food and service !
the games were fun and easy to win too .
highly recommended as a place to come and play in vegas !
excalibur wanted $ _num_ and wanted me out by 3pm !
great prices , large menu , wonderful staff , etc .
i was kinda iffy about staying here due to the cheap price .
i used to love going to that one with my mom as a child .
our beds were hard and worn .
dinner came and my veal bolognese was horrible .
very refreshing on a hot vegas day .
absolutely horrible and rude costumer service .
i would highly recommend it .
and its a shame because i really did like my room .
the pool scene was pretty sad .
i 've been a firefly customer for _num_ years !
it was really nice though !
thanks for a wonderful lunch experience !
ambience is great whether you dine in the cafe or main dining room .
definitely coming here again .
the server promised biscuits again , and left .
we chose the seasonal tasting menu and were so impressed .
this one is my favorite !
i 've stayed at excalibur quite a few times .
as soon as i walked into the lobby the long lines shocked me .
just do n't do it .
its a great place to hang out with friends and family .
it was well worth it !
i 'm still trying to figure out what the hell that covered .
this place is awesome .
this place is awesome .
this place is awesome .
this place is awesome .
such a cool place to visit !
all in all , a great restaurant .
she should have just thrown the crap away before she gave it to me .
everything in this hotel is run down .
was there on labor day weekend and it was a great experience .
servers were friendly and helpful .
i think it 's ideal .
all the tapas are great and the sangria makes is good as well .
i upgraded to a suite , total nightmare .
but the pillows were hard and the beds were harder .
i think the employees really dropped the ball this time .
_num_ hour has a good selection of machines .
too may nice courses in lv to play this dump .
no theme to the casino as opposed to other hotels .
try to get there for happy hours .
the director wanted a nice blonde wig .
this was a holiday weekend and this place was empty .
the hotel room was what you 'd expect .
the garlic shrimp was amazing !
our first time and spago lives up to it 's reputation !
but it is not a option .
everything was absolutely delicious and i will definitely be back again .
i wish i had looked this place up on yelp before i played here .
i 'm begging you , please stay somewhere else .
the casino was good as well .
the food is amazing and unlike the rest of vegas , not over priced .
the food is inventive and delicious .
the excalibur is the worst hotel on the strip .
i highly recommend getting the giant margarita glass full of frozen margarita .
he wants to go again tomorrow and the next day !
is that how a store is supposed to be run ?
as a vegas veteran , i know what to expect on the strip .
first off this restaurant is in serious need of a facelift .
_num_ yrs old facility going on _num_ .
i was pretty disappointed .
it was almost impossible to get a `` free '' drink .
harrahs casino in las vegas , what can i say .
other than that , spend a little more money to stay somewhere nicer !
it is absolute perfection !
always the `` best of the best '' regarding booze !
definitely world class service .
it has a kids casino , amusement park , and circus shows .
the midway was fun and you ca n't beat free entertainment .
it closes too early and opens too late .
absolutely terrible hotel , the worst i have experienced within the north america .
gone here before and many other car washes and never had this happen before .
this was my first tapas experience and i loved it .
it was supposed to be ready by _num_ pm .
came here twice so far .
it came with were dry .
awsome place and super friendly people .
then i shot it and loved it !
they gave exceptional service which was very much appreciated .
my carrot strip had more flavor .
it gets very very old after a while .
there is a bakery and everything is so yummy !
on a good note , the room is clean and the beds were comfortable .
we used their pool and the laundry machine which is top rate .
fantastic meal , the service and food were both perfect .
do n't even bother with this place .
this is one of the worst mc d 's .
( but that thing never happened . )
tonight may be the last night we ever go there .
i got the _num_ octane with one shot and it was good .
this is n't the case .
it was however , very greasy .
they were busy so obviously people come here but sorely disappointed is an understatement .
matt was so very helpful and professional today .
anywho , love love love !
happy hour prices are ridiculous .
this is my favorite hotel casino in vegas .
apparently it 's a `` request '' not a reservation .
food here is also pretty good .
a bit pricy but well worth the money .
friends , family , dates , this place is perfect for everyone !
no wifi in the room is awful .
jenny is amazing at doing nails !
level of service was superb from the whole team .
great food , cool atmosphere !
pros -- cheap room price .
i stayed here with my wife for a couple of nights .
sugar content : extremely high .
she left an electronic tag on my yoga pants .
the staff is so attentive and professional - they are flawless .
i can say we all enjoyed our meals and the customer service was great .
no shower , etc .
a great place to make a great impression for a business meeting .
will not go back to this location again .
there was mold in the shower .
the mall itself is very old looking from the outside .
definitely a disappointing meal .
what a great shop !
surprisingly they have a pretty decent pool .
bartender is less than zero .
the bacon wrapped stuff dates are awesome !
service was friendly , but inattentive .
thank you so much from myself and my son !
you can always ask for more shots to put in your frozen delight .
the food came out really fast and was packed with flavor .
managers are extremely nice always around and checking on tables .
had a little fridge and microwave and glass cups , even silverware .
the staff is friendly and helpful even when it 's quite busy .
hubby had and enjoyed the jerk chicken pasta .
excellent italian cuisine where they will customize your meal .
everything we tasted were great , but by far my favorite is the lentils .
i 'd definitely eat there again .
i 'd definitely eat there again .
so happy we chose it as one of our dinner spots .
disappointed that they had run out of tempura green tea ice cream .
this place is the absolute worst .
the view from the restaurant window was terrific with the bellagio 's fountain show .
it was a very unique dining experience , being new to the tapas concept .
my boyfriend and i were both very disappointed in our stay .
service is immediate , bread , butter , drink orders , water all happen .
i was also pleased with the variety of dining choices .
it is worth the drive off the strip .
lots of fun folks running around here .
that is actually false , apart from the eating with your hands part .
it was cheap , in many ways .
it came out within ten minutes and was all hot and delicious .
this is not good business practices .
laugh with authentic vegas people ... god totally fun !
but do n't play the slots there , you ca n't win !
the whole enterprise is an embarrassment to good taste .
i could eat two of those and make it my dinner .
most pages wo n't load , if they do it takes 3-4 minutes .
refunded money , upgraded us , and gave us a late check out .
the room in tower i was very stuffy .
terrible food & bad service .
the starbucks wo n't take starbucks cards .
thank you dr. k and staff for your outstanding services .
for a college student this is a good place to kick it .
it 's just what you do ... .
i ate here on saturday night and i loved it .
the food was bad the eggs were not good !
i guess they truly did n't wish to sell the car .
i recommend getting the cheese plate appetizer and the sea bass .
it has a small kitchen , a good size fridge and a microwave .
not at all satisfied even with the discount price i paid .
but we notice not one difference in the room after that whole ordeal .
best happy hour in vegas !
the food was average , but the service was beyond slow .
the casino downstairs is okay , but not that great .
fat tuesday is great for getting a quick buzz .
absolute worst hotel i have ever stayed at .
amazing food at inexpensive prices .
this place was really good !
quite honestly one of the best restaurants i 've eaten at , ever.
seafood dishes are absolutely fresh , not bad for a chain restaurant .
food is excellent quality and prepared fresh and it shows in the taste .
disappointed to say the least and i had low expectations going into this place .
the drinks are good too .
he got so annoyed that we decided to get some sandwiches .
i just left ; hungry and disappointed !
this has to be the worst mcdonald 's i have ever been to .
there is no zen at this buddha dump .
the paradise location is the best .
guacamole is perfect , as is the queso fundido .
by this time , we were frustrated , super tired and just angry .
next best thing is it 's pretty mid strip !
i definitely got a good buzz from the octane .
windows so dirty you could n't see through them .
for a nicer experience get a suite .
our room was very nice .
but for a regular local there is n't much to see or do .
if you 're staying at a casino hotel , you should stay somewhere else .
however , we definitely will not be staying here again .
personally , i like the regular margaritas with an extra shot for $ _num_ .
i was also extremely disappointed by the customer service .
we had our wedding reception here and it was amazing .
the suite was awesome and my friends normal room was nice as well .
great off the strip happening spot .
wallpaper was patch worked & falling off the walls .
the bathroom in the room was moldy and musty and needed a complete remodel .
tip # _num_ : make sure to order the calamari to start !
i try to visit when in lv and really enjoy the food and service .
i washed my color clothes for about _num_ .
customer service deserves negative stars .
i recently stayed here on a quick _num_ night trip to vegas .
i do n't know if i 'll come back to this place .
only go here if you are expecting for over an hour to check in .
first , our waiter was top notch .
this is by far the worst experience i have had at any hotel .
the charge you $ _num_ for high speed internet .
oh , and the staff hate the guests .
free parking for my rental car was great .
the customer service was poor and unfriendly .
this place has never and probably will never do seafood justice .
amazing food and super fun ambiance !
the air conditioning in the room was either too cold or not working .
all the food is excellent there .
carmax was alright , but i hate buying a car .
the _num_ min craps were fun and a great deal .
quit so someone who wants to work can do it .
half the dessert menu requires that you order it _num_ minutes prior .
$ _num_ to $ _num_ for a fast food burger ?
and it wouldnt turn back off !
a very cool experience .
this place deserves _num_ stars !
apparently , english was n't her first language , either .
i did get a discount .
ok , so check this out .
however this time the soup tasted like a bowl of water .
fine , we were just wanting a few rolls and some miso anyways .
aside from that not worth staying there unless they comp you a room .
the service was attentive and the food arrived promptly and tasted delicious .
yeah ... not quite .
one of the best things i 've ever eaten in lv .
even the mojitos were good .
i think that 's so ridiculous .
i would never stay there again even if it was free .
will never stay here nor recommend it unless you want a dirt cheap hotel .
from all the hotels we where looking circus circus had the best price .
i thought that the food was very good .
my pain relief meds , etc .
beware , they only want your money .
nasty game they play .
i love this place , best gelato spot in vegas .
we were told that was the only available table ... but it was n't .
chips and salsa were really really good .
the tv was broken and would n't turn on .
chef did their part but my mood was ruined already .
came for happy hour .
ate there today and the food was really good !
it had a fast food food court and a questionable buffet .
and i honestly wanted to love this place but everything was mediocre at best .
they even have me comps for the buffet and comped my resort fee .
i definitely had one more shot , hahaha .
far superior to most of the hotel high dollar famous chefs .
everything was pretty good and once again the prices were great .
they also have a full bar , including a wide selection of flavored mojitos .
probably would not return .
customer service is also great .
i had really good time there .
the margarita flavor is pretty good .
literally little chewy rubber bands of bland breading .
forget this place and stay at the tropicana !
they said no because we had insurance .
the staff , for the most part is friendly and accommodating .
i like that they have two different menus .
great attention and service .
this place is a disgusting joke .
smelly , smelly , smelly .
its ridiculous to pay for parking and then for there to be none .
nice white wine list .
the sides were good too ... some flavored rice , and black beans .
_num_ minutes later , no water .
customer service is always friendly .
that was a fun afternoon .
i definitely loved the selections we all got .
then _num_ mins just to get our food .
always add a shot though .
its great for large groups or a small date .
the sangria is also super tasty .
this is completely unacceptable .
that would have been nice to know at booking .
wo n't be using them again if possible .
awesome ... authentic street food .
the best cheap hotel that i prefer is the flamingo .
i was so disappointed with the deal .
_num_ octane and hurricane together are great .
why do they even put people in such conditions ?
they definitely topped my expectations .
it really has that caribbean feel to it .
the inside is beautiful .
all flash , no substance .
i would only stay here again if i was desperate .
housekeeping did a fantastic job keeping my room clean for a week .
happy hour on point and the drinks are strong !
both were very delicate and rich in flavors .
free shuttle to rio , bally 's and paris .
i was impressed with the monorail !
the place is nothing special .
the food was delicious and the servers were very friendly and helpful !
the service was quite good as was the food .
the maintenance man that came was grumpy and halfway rude .
highly recommend these folks !
the pasta was so delicious .
great find in the area .
thank you once again , i will back again soon .
price for both w/ coffee - $ _num_ .
excalibur did n't disappoint my low expectations .
but our dragon family style meal was outstanding !
there are only _num_ customers in the whole place !
great deal for _num_ of us .
they had lots of military guns to choose from and their prices were great !
will defiantly be coming back !
you ca n't sell until you pay it off completely .
like i said , its basically a holiday inn on the strip .
pleasant atmosphere with cool decor .
great restaurant that we go to every time we 're in town .
it was that good .
service and suits were good , but wanted a second opinion before buying .
you must also try their sparkling sangria ... very good .
the one thing i will mention about the tapas : seafood dishes are good .
the wall paper in the bathroom was peeling .
told her it was unacceptable .
`` cough drops ? ''
the size of this place is ridiculously small .
but the dates were incredible .
if you are in las vegas , treat yourself to this las vegas landmark .
i loved all the items they carry .
chips and salsa are great !
the pizza with the egg on top was phenomenal .
extremely strong and delicious drinks .
i can not wait to check out of this place .
instead of relaxing i had to listen to these little kids run around .
driving there and back just took an hour out of my day .
_num_ of them _num_ star , _num_ of them _num_ star .
the bagel : nothing special at all .
if i could , i would give them _num_ stars .
this place is nasty .
delicious and left enough room for the pie .
i also appreciate that they make their own pastrami .
i always have the sangria .
they definately are not maintained however .
definitely recommend this place so far .
nothing to report there .
cool atmosphere , great staff and terrific food .
he was much better than the waiter .
a lot of food for what you pay too !
the ceviche was amazing , the bacon wrapped dates were also amazing .
these diced potatoes were mushy and sticky in a weird kind of way .
suffice it to say , i will never stay here again .
everything was a success .
gambling is relaxed and fun , many new upgrades have been done .
then he stared at us and wondered why he did n't get a tip .
our two boys were so excited to go for the first time .
please improve , do n't make me stop coming here altogether .
excellent , cool and refreshing on a hot vegas day !
great place to go and prices were reasonable !
i 've been here twice now , and i 'll be back again !
i had no other choice , i was told to stay here .
have been here maybe _num_ years ago , pretty disappointing .
the almond stuffed dates are awesome !
i had the jerk shrimp appetizer with the cuban bread and loved it .
ok , i guess it 's self service .
great service , fresh bagels , great prices .
the service was great and the portion size was just the right amount .
if you 're in vegas this is the nike for you .
my friend and i were getting the $ _num_ spa mani and pedi .
you know when it is bad when their dessert are not home made .
great place for visitors from out of town or for special occasions .
wifi did n't work .
the penne ala vodka was good .
we got there and immediately noticed it was very hot !
do n't waste your time here !
harrahs is not where i will be staying ever again .
fun atmosphere , and delicious .
i did n't even stay here so i am reviewing their casino floor .
the room itself was decent , nothing special .
overall , i do not regret my surgery , i regret using them .
i got the lobster gnocchi which was pretty good .
not happy with them .
the whole thing is disgusting .
i left a message and never got a call back .
that makes a start to for a fun day .
the room was decent and clean and the staff was helpful and polite .
you can also check in early so you have a table waiting .
wo n't go back .
try it once , and you 'll be hooked .
i highly recommend spago .
the twin sisters that play are awesome !
it was a bit strange .
beds are comfy but it 's downhill from there .
i hear they got a spot like this in the bay now too .
miso soup was way too salty .
everything is always fresh but perhaps a little pricey .
did i say horrible ?
yelp helped me find the place for a business meeting , everyone loved it .
this was my worst automotive decision ever .
saved us a cab ride or _num_ !
wait times are incredibly long .
there is construction being done at 7am and they were not aware .
there were hardly people there and it was n't fun at all .
chips came with fresh guacamole and salsa .
later i found out that it is a korean run restaurant .
was n't expecting much , but had a wonderful dinner with amazingly cooked meat .
seriously the nicest and honest sales man that u ever need .
everyone in the office is pleasant and chatty .
love love love this place !
love love love this place !
the service is friendly and impeccable .
the presentation of the dishes looks fantastic .
everything seems to be a little more bland .
great wines , seafood , short ribs ... everything was exceptional .
the restaurant is absolutely stunning .
th pool area was okay , nothing special .
great bagels , great eats , fun environment !
it is literally just a decent place to sleep and shower .
the wait staff is great and the prices are good .
very fishy and rotten smell .
highly recommend this hospital for children they truly and honestly care for their patients .
purchased weekend stay thru expedia .
they are this amazing combination of tart , sweet , and refreshing .
and agnolotti pasta was excellent !
the arcade is awful .
the hotel amenities are among the worst on the strip .
nothing luxury about it .
not paying for something that i did not receive .
i own the business across the street and they always waste my time .
i never once got cold food .
our waiter was very attentive and friendly .
best place to have lunch and or dinner .
although i 'm not an expert on mexican food i enjoyed this experience .
to begin this hotel was relatively expensive compared to some places here in vegas .
he is super nice and helpful .
eventually , many of my friends stayed here and i went elsewhere .
but at night they are slower than slow .
and now here i am _num_ days later still throwing up .
the bread was really good too .
i have never seen an air filter as filthy as this one .
first off , who puts pink roses on a ninja turtle cake ?
i give this place _num_ stars for their sushi and sushi chef .
i agree with all the bad reviews , save your money !
this is absolutely ridiculous !
excellent service and selection .
do n't settle just to be on the strip .
ambiance was trendy and romantic - great date spot .
the tapas platters were all each very good .
i just checked into the contemporary superior room and am definitely not impressed .
great food and great service with an incredible ambiance !
the best part is it 's free !
the room was nice though .
staff , food and eric the chef ... top notch !
good dining experience , but a bit pricey .
also the water served did n't taste that good .
get to the room and ugh .
overall , wonderful dining experience .
price for rooms were great .
but you get what you pay for ... not much .
it 's very unfortunate , because the food was very delicious .
the only plus was the location , which was next door to my conference .
so , _num_ minutes later , we were finally on our way .
service was great and the food was an adventure .
the food here was delicious .
there was no central ac .
warning : to all future vegas tourists , this is overpriced .
the food was always good .
i recommend stopping by .
they said that area is full is so ridiculous .
always a good time : ) cheers !
it was overall a good stay and i would definitely come back .
the wifi was `` down '' for the whole time we stayed there .
it ruined out trip .
they have so much flavor !
yeah , just do n't .
yeah , just do n't .
since i could not get back to sleep , i decided to go out .
there on business and not good .
front desk was not helpful at all .
they took care of us pretty good.
drinks were excellent , and the food was unbelievable .
my favorites are the eggplant cannelloni and the dates .
buffet was pretty bad ... see my review for it .
when we arrived , we were told there would be a _num_ minute wait .
if you want them to print out your boarding pass another $ _num_ .
the guy serving me was very friendly and efficient .
free wi-fi advertised but very weak signal - constantly lost contact .
he did n't offer us desserts i had to ask for it myself .
did not even offer water at the time we placed the order .
i have stayed there maybe 10-15 times .
$ _num_ chicken wings - basic order wings , hot sauce , ranch .
the layout of this store is so very nice .
seriously , no other way to describe it other than butt .
i came back _num_ minutes later to find the car still sitting there .
i came back _num_ minutes later to find the car still sitting there .
the food was decent , but the server was horrible .
overall it was great .
love the con ... hate the venue .
the place is divey for sure , but it 's great !
they have a great selection of beers and cocktails in the happy hour !
the only bright spot was buca di beppo .
the food is absolutely amazing , great selection , kind manager .
this place is essentially the motel _num_ of the strip .
i could bare my hear the waiter or the other guests at my table .
trash is everywhere inside and outside .
this is a piece of crap property .
i 'm glad i did n't .
there has to better choices off the strip .
waste of money and overrated !
i got the paella and really enjoyed .
there 's no safety bolt on the door .
had an amazing , cozy , romantic dinner with my husband .
the portion are not satisfying for the price you have to pay per dish .
this is fine dining .
drove past this place so many times over the years and never stopped .
i like that this location is off the strip so probably not as busy .
finally after _num_ hours decided to deal with once in vegas .
went to the cafe for diner and there _num_ prime rib special .
it is great food , great service and great atmosphere .
it 's just too bad that they 're stuck at this crappy hotel .
she 's hard at hearing .
the empanadas were very good and the dipping sauce even better .
even the mustard was tasteless and old tasting .
i 'm sure they 'll go out of business soon .
the safe in the room did not work .
i highly doubt they are serving fresh chicken .
this place said no to separate checks , so many of our group left .
the parent was in the actual dining room , not the play area room .
instead , he came back and gave me a new card .
this was a huge mistake .
the food taste sooooo good .
good food but bad service .
our server was very nice and patient .
the hotel also has access to the monorail .
food is a _num_ if i could rate it .
still the same horrible quality .
still the same horrible quality .
did n't think much about it since we were n't staying there .
_num_ hours later , i returned to my room .
i think circus circus is better than this place .
i just signed up for yelp to write a review of this hotel .
the assortment of breads is great , esp .
i 've stayed here almost every time i visit vegas .
i have never stayed at a hotel and seen this .
we will not stay here next time .
absolutely wonderful service , staff , and care .
the food is still great and i 'll be back again and again .
i 've had great service at discount firearms !
it 's always good walking through in here !
, but overall we were happy with our decision to try this place !
while both were pretty good , neither were great .
well there went my night .
this is a nice place to hang out i will be back asap .
i am not impressed at all .
stains on the carpet , and the beds were in horrible condition .
i could 've eaten that thing with a spoon !
so i booked the room .
i loved this monorail .
the chips with salsa and guacamole is a must !
we stayed in the `` better tower '' which is number _num_ .
wonderful food at the cafe side .
staff was friendly , but food was not all that great .
i woke up one morning to find cockroaches crawling over my shoes .
they did n't give us the drinks with the kids meals .
i loved my sweet and sour pork .
there are no mirrors in the rooms besides the one in the bathroom .
wolfgang 's chinese take on chicken salad still is the best !
i also loved the shrimp with chili sauce ; lots of spice and flavor .
good homemade food in a restaurant .
it put a bad taste in all our mouths .
great place to come to get traditional filipino food .
you would think someone would get _num_ + _num_ .
the casino always has a good vibe and the rooms are always clean .
after ordering brownie with ice cream i gave up .
no bugs , but i did find hair ... and lots of it !
do n't waist your money on this filthy dirty place !
i think it sums up how old and backwards the hotel is .
this place gets a good crowd .
my husband and i stayed here for three nights .
we sat at the bar and bartender did a great job serving us .
will not come again and will not suggest to any of my friends .
it does n't smell weird , either .
i ca n't say i enjoyed myself here .
love the table games here .
it practically sounded like the windows were open .
the walls are also paper thin .
i am so glad that i found this place !
i really do love this place .
i 'm better off going to a different furniture company .
but why is it so damn cold at night during the summer !
everything we 've tried here has been great .
happy hour is great .
the staff is incredibly friendly and really make you feel welcome .
my stylist was rude and was shaking when she was doing my hair .
avoid this place at all costs if you are going there for food !
my pasta with roasted rabbit was soooooo good and tender .
speaking of towels , the pool is n't open at all .
we tried _num_ dishes and loved them all .
the people complaining are just those people that are never happy .
i got the combo pho soup with beef and meatballs .
i had a hot water leak under my house .
but food really was a major let down .
the food is good and reasonably priced .
central to the strip and beautiful through and through .
overall we had a great experience and would return to circus circus .
lobster shanghai style was delicious .
but this property in las vegas is old , dirty and low class now .
really enjoyed the pineapple margarita that was recommended by server .
some of them are outstanding at that .
the food was surprisingly tasty .
its not that it is a dive .
the rooms are nice , clean , comfortable and the price is very reasonable .
the huge pool was not open during our whole stay .
i am completely amazed .
i wo n't return here !
there is a serious lack of communication at this hotel .
i recommend the cat _num_ hurricane with an extra shot for $ _num_ .
i recommend everyone that i know to it .
beds are hard and there is no fridge or microwave .
the ceiling has an ugly water leak stain across the top .
great service and great value .
it took _num_ mins to check because they could n't find our reservation .
plenty of other better ayce restaurants in vegas .
she could of just said no .
which just helped the already beautiful atmosphere .
harrah 's is in serious need of a complete renovation top to bottom .
next time i think we will pay the extra money to stay elsewhere .
i could n't get help because no one seemed to understand english .
amazing food , this location it is always pretty packed so plan accordingly .
not comfortable at all .
really , really liked this place .
this was the last hotel stay during our national park tour before flying home .
the staff and dealers are rude .
i hate seeing good people get treated like garbage .
i would strongly urge anyone to think twice about going here .
the dinning options here are not acceptable .
i could not win with these rooms .
loved my spinach salad and the salmon and sweet corn were to die for .
thank you firefly and aaron for a wonderful meal and fabulous drinks !
was n't too impressed with the room though .
horrible customer service and cleanliness , i guess you get what you pay for .
sorry harrah but you lost our business .
do n't waste your time .
do n't waste your time .
worst service , i checked out early .
we are n't coming back .
our poor experience started right away .
hubby steps in and says it 's the brakes .
sadly , excalibur managed to screw up my reservation .
the price of the passes is very affordable & worth every penny .
_num_ happy hours and mojitos are amazing .
there were no other customers in there except for me .
rx for a good time ... .
the carne is always cooked to perfection .
great prices as well .
only about _num_ customers .
lamb chops are also amazing , actually everything on the menu is amazing .
the food was great and the service was even better !
the worst place i have ever been in my life !
i really appreciate they do anything to saved my phone .
we had great service and even better food .
they have so many different items to please any palette .
great food for great value !
so a week later again they call me your car ready come get it .
the pasta was tasty and addicting .
i was so disappointed by everything .
first of all , it was slow .
also the bread service was awesome .
the food is always well cooked , with fresh ingredients and depth of flavor .
it was that bad .
the service was fantastic , the appetizers excellent and the drinks strong .
worst pickup experience ever .
this place is great !
this place is great !
this place is great !
requested extra pillows , given a hard time .
the service was friendly and efficient as well .
magic in ones mouth !
this hotel is not amazing , but for the price , it is good.
great service , been here couple times and never a let down .
next time we go to vegas we will definitely do this again .
the sales people and owner are not honest .
( without a picture ) what a nightmare .
a few times we just parked at new york new york and walked over .
the people who work there are very friendly and helpful .
my three kids loved it .
they came highly recommended by friends and we 'd recommend them as well .
they 've got a great wine list as well .
another had a cigarette burn in it .
another had a cigarette burn in it .
they have great food and their bagels are amazing .
service was fast and food was great .
kids had a great time .
the wild mushroom enchiladas are amazing .
terrible terrible terrible place .
both are very refreshing and a good combination of ingredients .
i would recommend this place .
this place is addicting !
only check this place out if you 're in the area .
only problem we had was the noise factor !
visiting for the weekend and found i yelp .
i 'm sorry i understand things go up but not _num_ .
every time i come here my family and i always enjoy our dishes !
( it 's kind of like popcorn , smoke , and pee ) .
i stayed there this past friday night i was in a room _num_ .
next time im going to the butcher block on south rainbow .
staff was very nice and accomodating .
spago is always one of the best ... .
it 's refreshing with their coconut shrimp pasta .
to me , that 's unacceptable , regardless of how cheap the rooms are .
had a _num_ dollar coupon from their web sight .
we did receive awesome discounts for food and drinks .
take the time to swing by and have some fun !
i love this environment .
it definitely has that appeal .
it 's a reasonable price here so worth the wait .
the tuna tartare looked like cat food .
what bother me the most was the fact that i asked for water twice .
they did n't bother to move the seats forward to vacuum .
it was room _num_ .
i love their margaritas also .
this has never happened to me at any hotel or motel , ever !
the basics in hotel amenities were not met .
great , great place .
i loved the way they delivered the food ... .
so , then he takes _num_ minutes to bring me cocktail sauce .
try it and you 'll see .
it was all bland .
too bad i did n't have much time and just wanted the battery replaced .
this place is an absolute joke .
one of my favorite places since moving to vegas .
each time i went there , i took advantage of the tuesday special .
the decor has n't changed in years .
then i shot at the range today !
all they did was to offer me a refund on my resort taxes .
fantastic food and service .
the worst service i have had .
we had a caesar that was very good .
the food is delicious !
the chicken wings were way too sweet .
highly recommended and a must have for every vegas trip i take !
it was decent , not terrible .
could 've used a little tlc .
nice rooms and huge casino .
that 's so frustrating .
when back in vegas , we will definitely dine here again .
the problem is everything else .
luckily , since i had reserved a table i was seated right away .
they took _num_ days to set up the internet and still didnt get there .
great service and great people ... .
needless to say that was a hit with the entire group !
you meet wonderful people of every age .
thank you once again for an excellent stay !
really a good place to unwind .
i definitely appreciated the gesture .
as i mentioned before , pass .
nope ... was n't me .
our server was very entertaining and really catered to our needs .
overall it was a great experience .
the wait was _num_ minutes which was fine .
maybe ... no , definitely avoid their chicken .
just as fun as the real thing !
this room is painted white with nothing in it .
she did nothing and diagnosed nothing .
the food is reasonably priced and everything i have tried is amazing .
room : old , dirty , used up .
my mom loves everything on the menu .
also the bathrooms have no tubs , just standing showers .
i wo n't be back again .
i am sure the other flavors are great as well .
i asked them what happened and they told me it was already like that .
the corn agnolotti pasta dish is soooo delicious .
matt had me in the right direction and i picked an awesome wig !
this place cracks me up !
it does not compare to the one in southern california which is way newer .
rooms are clean , stocked , and smells really good .
tip : expand to the airport ... .
strawberry is great too .
bed is rock hard and the lights in the bathroom do n't work .
there are plenty of options for grabbing a quick bite .
this is my favorite casual restaurant in all of vegas to date !
enjoy it if you 're in vegas .
but the rooms are tiny and the beds are not that great .
overall a terrible experience .
one of my least favorite ross locations .
its reasonably priced and pretty fast .
he made my sandwiches , then cut them wrapped them and put them aside .
this is the best spanish restaurant period !
the best part was we shared it !
this particular experience was un acceptable .
the food was great , and the prices were even better .
but vegas offers few choices so we went .
it was rather dry considering it 's price .
the best cheapest way to get around .
it was undercooked in places , lacked cheese and flavor !
i recomend the squash soup , so creamy and full of flavor .
this was a great little place tucked away off the strip .
doug was my instructor the first time an he is great .
be cautious and remember you get what you pay for !
overall we had a great experience .
this is certainly not a place fork people who want to eat healthy .
cost : $ _num_ plus taxes fees etc .
was told i would be contacted by risk management but never heard a word .
let me tell you , it was strong but the flavor was so good !
of all the apple stores in vegas , this one is my personal favorite .
big rich was a fabulous tour guide .
left disappointed and empty handed .
horrible service , dirty rooms and broken tvs !
it was very dated and the wall paper was peeling .
this is the best thing ever ... do it !
drain in the bath tub could n't keep up with the shower .
employees and courteous and friendly .
the salsa was pretty good and tasted homemade and authentic .
everything is good here & drinks are good .
good fine dining food .
i paid _num_ too much .
do not put your vacation in risk !
i really hope this chain makes its way over to the east coast .
i 've always appreciated good art and the modern masters exhibit is wonderful .
i did not like the sauce .
your voice recognition we were so pleased by her professionalism and sincere hospitality .
room was n't great by any standard .
everything was great , in particular the chicken .
took us _num_ min to get someone to open it .
clean and very friendly staff .
unfortunately , the server had no idea either .
great food for the price !
this would be that place .
prepare to be approached by timeshare salesmen .
very good with the octopus and lamb chops my favorites .
unfortunately this last stay rubbed me wrong at the start .
i would definitely recommend checking this place out .
not worth the money no matter how cold it was .
it 's nice and creamy the way i like it .
the staff here is genuine and actually listen to your shopping needs .
really good tapas , but go for happy hour .
they did a good job .
so a week later i get call from them it 's ready .
crab , prime rib , ribs ... yum !
we called back , were put on hold and disconnected .
he was very efficient and knowledgeable and made my experience great .
but the next trip , we 're definitely staying elsewhere .
when it arrived it looked , smelled and tasted like a frozen pizza .
the food , the ambient , everything is amazing !
we started with the chips , salsa and guacamole which was very good .
especially in _num_ degree plus weather .
my friends all loved the dish too and could n't get enough of it .
this is not a good hotel .
this is not a good hotel .
this is not a good hotel .
this is not a good hotel .
the staff from the valet to the vendors were super nice & professional .
great quick service with a happy staff .
cheap place to stay .
the room was equally bad .
people pay for the service you provide and your service is terrible .
this is a great way to get around vegas .
i 'm just so disappointed with their customer care attitude .
this restaurant was a great surprise to me .
i suggest spending your money elsewhere .
very quick to deliver .
they have no courtesy whatsoever .
the room had two small lights .
perfect place for tapas !
told us that it would be a _num_ minute wait .
i 'll be back again !
loved the petite filet ... great deal for $ _num_ .
great location and they have a lot of penny slots .
what a cool place .
an extensive wine list and we get to enjoy the fountain in our seat .
banana bread pudding was a great conclusion .
also great selection of authentic new york style deli offerings .
walk into most other hotels on the strip and then walk into the excalibur .
i 'm not even exaggerating .
i was so happy to get the good news from them .
gals , i know what you go through and i feel ya !
happy hour at the bar is fun as they give you little appetizers .
so the rating is for the food and our specific server .
this place smells like shit and cigarettes !
this one 's terrible .
love love this place .
a reasonably priced and great tasting drink .
the kitchen prepared one for me and it was heaven !
this place was awful .
my husband and i enjoyed lunch there on sunday .
outlets are an issue , and garbage cans are super small .
most hotels do n't care , besides we only wanted an hour extra time !
the next time i 'm in lv , i 'll be skipping this place .
great service and wonderful cocktails .
meatloaf is the best !
the greatest food ever !
the atmosphere here is hype be trendy and the vibe is phenomenal .
their signature restaurants are buca de beppo and dick 's last resort .
then acted like using my boyfriends rewards card was illegal .
she has a great personality and was extremely helpful .
great place for dates !
will definitely go back .
it was total crap .
this place is way over rated .
not a hello welcome or anything .
has all the new slot machines and awesome stores inside the casino .
i ca n't believe it is still in business .
i would not come back .
this place has great happy hour specials !
doug was our instructor and he was great .
on the whole , a wonderful experience .
us texas gals love guacamole !
we simply loved it .
best tapas and best value !
it was the perfect dish .
great hotel for fun vacation with kids .
my tuna was seared perfectly leaving the inside a tender sashimi .
rest of staff never gave me a shit .
this is a place i am always up for going to .
it 's two saturdays before xmas and the mall is packed .
this was miles above on both flavor and texture .
delicious , great atmosphere , friendly service , gourmet mexican food !
the deal was for all week not just thursday or maybe friday .
thank you so much ... i 'm beyond happy !
it is perfectly portioned and the food tasted great too .
great service great food and great service .
one of my favorite places to eat in vegas .
well there are still trouble shooting steps that you can take . ''
not even cadillac would have charged me that much .
are the empty beer and water glasses not enough of a clue ?
would recommend this place to everyone .
plenty of space to do makeup and hair .
customer service was terrible !
this place has a great view of the canal .
best thing i paid for in vegas during these hot summer months .
the dinner buffet is pretty decent , but could use some work .
do n't get fooled by the low rates .
next time i go i might try something new !
_num_ ) no water pressure to speak of in the shower .
i live right near it and always mean to hit it again .
i loved loved loved all of my floral decor !
it is not like you are going to stay in the room that long .
the carpet is nasty .
excellent , fairly affordable tapas in las vegas .
with that in mind , this hotel did not impress me very much .
the flautas were perfectly executed , tasty , crispy outside , flavorful chicken inside .
the staff was incredible though .
the room and hallway look tired and dumpy .
i will definitely always come back to dragon noodle for some delicious sushi .
the cafe was decent for breakfast but we ate our other meals elsewhere .
i used to think the strip was the shit .
other than that i know why my stay was only $ _num_ a night !
hard to get decent east coast bagels here and this place hit it .
very surprised at seeing the seafood selection .
parking is a mess and way over priced .
lemonade was best i have tasted .
service , atmosphere , drinks and food .
highly recommend this store .
this place is great .
this place is great .
this place is great .
this place is great .
this place is great .
if you 're a local there is a nice discount as well .
because it was , it really was .
the food is very tasty and quite plentiful .
this hotel is cheap , so it brings in lower end customers .
the buffet for lunch is great .
she said `` no unless you use room service . ''
this is one of our favorite places to eat in las vegas .
they had an amazing selection .
they try to sell you a time share and waste your day !
great waiter , great service , wonderful drinks and food !
even if you do n't refill it it 's a great deal .
they were so sweet and funny .
freaking long line but they only have _num_ employees working .
a confusing parking structure with zero signage to help you get to the hotel .
the atmosphere was a refreshing change from all the hotel restaurants .
it 's a great menu with good service and a superb location .
if i could give this hotel _num_ stars , i would .
it was unique and very good .
always make it a mission to have one when in vegas !
i went here for dinner last night because i was craving a margherita pizza .
most evenings , a light , but free , dinner .
embarrassing for las vegas .
bar food in a dirty run down place .
i was grossly too slow on giving up on her !
the nurses and doctors we interacted with were all wonderful , friendly and professional .
you 'll thank me later .
you 'll thank me later .
to cap it off we could n't get a cab for about _num_ minutes .
the salsa was a perfect slightly spicy thin consistency .
reception desk people are less than friendly .
this place is pretty cool because there was a tv in the bathroom !
we were lucky enough that it stopped right at our hotel .
our room smelled awful and the floor was wet .
and i like the sangria - just writing this makes me happy !
my husband had the steak and eggs and the steak was juicy and tender .
this is one of the best restaurants on the strip .
we walked the strip and were stopped twice more on way in .
we walked the strip and were stopped twice more on way in .
i had dinner and the food was great , service was great !
employees look miserable and hardly anyone is smiling .
this gentleman was very accommodating and polite .
both times we went and ordered our food they screwed up our sandwiches .
they are also updating the hotel and everything will be new and fresh soon .
i strongly recommend anyone to come in and experience a wonderful time !
the tapas were great with many variety .
worst denny 's ever !
worst denny 's ever !
the halls smell , and the rooms are small and ugly .
no , thank you , that 's not what i needed .
the cookies are also awesome !
well , its actually two free drinks per stay , not day .
the food and service were great .
the one star was for the nasty museum attendants not for the museum itself .
all sorts of seafood but not an overwhelming fishy flavor .
the colors are just dreadful .
what a pleasant surprise !
because it was so hard , it was n't nice to eat either .
the new manager there was awful no people skills what so ever .
bagels fresh and new york style .
the toilet water was all over the wrap that i carry my baby in .
fair selection on cars and all but had a terrible experience .
do n't get me wrong , i really enjoyed the food .
i really do n't understand how this place had such good reviews .
rooms are very old and tired .
rooms were really nice .
my love for this place still remains strong .
definitely a fun time !
because the steamed rice was edible , i decided to be fair .
checking in , the lady was rude .
customer service was amazing , our salesperson was brenda .
there just feels like there 's nothing special here .
it was really disgusting .
i paid $ _num_ for early check in and it was ready as promised .
thank you we love it .
employees seemed happy and nice .
the stuffed dates are a party in my mouth !
the place has aged and is in need of some serious updating and renovation .
the light in the lamp was falling out .
everyone is always extremely helpful , friendly , and efficient .
whether you 're on a smoking floor or not , you are .
the prices are very reasonable .
avoid this place like the plague !
you can really tell they have a passion for what they do .
i rarely take the time to write a review but everything here was terrible .
the food here was great !
very pretty at night time .
i will not be coming back here .
these guys have no clue what customer service is .
merchandise looks dirty and not well taken care of .
first impression - the carpet and hallway were dirty and dingy .
this is the worst experience i 've ever had in vegas .
the food was good but the people working tonight were miserable .
the soda fountains are so dirty they do n't taste like soda .
for starters , i ordered the _num_ course wine pairing .
it is very fast and convenient .
i upgraded to a suite & honestly it looked like a regular room .
min then i had to wait for _num_ hrs just for a oil change .
awful , awful , awful !
i advise that you avoid this place at all costs .
could n't even get the car up the tiny incline of our driveway .
from the minute you walk in everyone is extremely nice & very helpful .
easy to find , so go and enjoy the experience .
great staff , always friendly .
i had one in hand constantly last time i visited .
we went into our room and it was dark and it smelled really bad .
i will have sweets dreams of all these amazing flavors .
literally , 10+ an hour .
the serving was gigantic and easily shared .
wine selection is also amazing !
they were very courteous and helpful .
totally ruined my vegas vacation !
when we arrived at our room , someone else was inside already .
great view of the strip as well .
could get a bit busy at times but overall it 's great .
keep up the professional great service !
i really enjoyed the walk through , although it can be a little confusing .
the best tapas in town .
it pays to go here .
cheap happy hour drinks as well .
it 's a good place to stay if you have small kids .
if you see an open seat , you 're lucky - take it .
an experience i 'll never forget !
always a fun and happy place to be in .
i wo n't listen to them next time .
everything was very good and reasonably priced .
the service was n't that good , either .
we even brought kids with us one time , and they enjoyed the food .
we were ignored by almost every staff member .
the a/c in our room was so loud ... sounded like something was broken .
as far as vegas goes this is the best !
but the fact that i love oysters makes me come here .
needless to say , this was incredibly annoying .
the sweet corn was so good !
everything else was just as disappointing .
but if you want a chain style caribbean version , bahama breeze is great .
figure out how to get them the basics quickly .
a local suggested this to me and i can see why !
good thing about it is that it is open _num_ hours .
is n't this damn hotel geared toward families ?
they just rude , `` what do you want ?
the burrito is especially good and so is the guacamole .
- it feels dirty .
i love you james .
i go here every year taking friends , and spago is first class period .
there was a bath bar , facial bar , and bottle of hand lotion .
this is a great deli to eat at in lv .
the range even provides the gun and ammo !
the only problem was the bed and the awful sheets !
it was n't even my order .
as soon as you walk in the door , you can smell the smoke .
this _num_ year old property still has no wi-fi .
the food is actually pretty good here .
however , the casino and the buffet are pretty disappointing .
sangria and mojitos are smooth plus their calamari and paella are delicious .
it 's clean , well lit , and seems very safe .
it was never cleaned and they allowed us to check in still .
$ _num_ menu states comes with your choice of potatoes and veggies .
i stayed in tower _num_ for _num_ days !
i tried to reach house keeping could not , waited forty minutes on hold .
it is huge and has an exciting feel to it .
my mistake i forgot to show my groupon .
felt this would be a better fit than the hard rock for them .
felt this would be a better fit than the hard rock for them .
i had a great experience .
as usual , outstanding !
well worth your time .
great front desk staff and the rooms are cozy and nice .
why are posted hours till 1am .
this place was so good !
maybe she had a bad night .
i had fresh pasta and it was perfect al dente .
i heart tapas and firefly does it perfectly .
drinks are strong and the food is tasty !
the rooms were not that great .
lunch special selections are great !
mac n cheese was good not great .
but , my recent experiences have been disappointing .
try it , but do n't say i did n't warn you .
great food , great enviroment , great drinks , friendly and great service !
the floor we were on and the room itself were musty and moldy smelling .
very uncomfortable to watch other folks eat .
nigiri was not fresh .
had egg foo young for lunch , which was ok .
we could n't have really asked for any more in that department .
not so happy with my _num_ night stay .
the _num_ bedroom suite was perfect for everyone .
rooms were old , smelled of smoke and wet carpet .
it really was fine , nothing bad or gross .
rooms are not all that great .
pretty good food overall .
service could have been better .
i live in vegas and this restaurant is one of my favorite places .
i 'm very disappointed with this place .
on the way to our table we counted _num_ empty tables .
which was pretty cool .
well worth the money for sure !
hubby loved the mushroom enchiladas , i somewhat enjoyed the shrimp burrito .
i walked out of her office that day and will not return ever !
the prices are cheap and it is for a good reason .
star service and food !
everything was well prepared and it was a great presentation .
the sports book is small and cramped , as is the poker room .
loud but lively atmosphere .
affordable , wonderful food - definitely try the sausage and the meatballs !
so , they came and ripped off the blow dryer from the wall .
the black and white cookie is great also !
we also had $ _num_ worth of clothing removed from our room .
i had a jambalaya and it was just awful .
my 10th time to vegas and this is my least favorite hotel .
i walked in and it looked no one had cleaned it .
it came with the most delicious tomatoes in balsamic and warm potato salad .
i ended up buying a las vegas shirt here and it 's great quality .
loved the salad and the very attentive service .

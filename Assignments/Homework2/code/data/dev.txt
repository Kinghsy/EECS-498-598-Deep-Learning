0 no sign of the manager .
0 the last couple years this place has been going down hill .
0 last night however it was way to thick and tasteless .
0 it smelled like rotten urine .
0 i am not exaggerating .
0 it was obvious it was the same damn one he brought the first time .
0 i tried to eat it but it was disgusting .
0 i pushed it aside and did n't eat anymore .

0 `` oh , my bad .
0 so , ended up going to a place called scramble .
0 it wasnt busy so i dont get why they had any dirty tables !
0 at that point , we were irritated and just got up and left .
0 ten minutes later , another couple was seated at the next table .

0 its gross to look at .
0 piss me off and i talked to their parents .
0 this is not the first time we have been kept waiting either .
0 not much selection here and a lot of dried food items .
0 disappointed to say the least .
0 the cash register area was empty and no one was watching the store front .
0 i stopped him to ask questions and he was condescending and impatient .
0 it certainly was n't for patient care or respect .
0 it started out well though .
0 this total cost for a new system was going to be about $ _num_ .

0 a disappointing electronics store for its size .
0 then they acted like they could have cared less about helping me .
0 sorry to say , they lost me as a customer .
0 neither is customer service .
0 in addition to this , the price was marked wrong on the shelf .
0 the store feels like you 're going into a dirty walmart .
0 if someone 's helpful , it 's because they 're getting commission .
0 it was so not appropriate and scared every little child that walked in .
0 we quickly walked past it to the computer area .
0 we enter the laptop area and walked past five employees .
0 no one said a word to us even though they made eye contact .

0 they were very helpful and offered to match any price from fry 's .

0 this is a pretty short review as i have minimal nice things to say .
0 if its in the weekly ad they probably will not have any in stock .
0 i know that your store 's prices are cheaper than almost any place locally .
0 it does not mean you should roll your eyes at them .
0 oddly enough , they do n't match their own online prices .

0 but it 's full of frustration to shop now .
0 do n't waste your time at this place .

0 the `` women '' at the front desk are extremely rude .
0 this place is an unsafe dump .
0 please do n't make the same mistake we did .
0 the last bill was just under $ _num_ .
0 go to another dentist if you want to be taken care of properly .
0 i really want a rug thats not priced .
0 each time , the guy took a message and never called me back .
0 not sure why it was recommended .
0 the techs there are more concerned with chatting with friends than helping a customer .
0 waited _num_ minutes for help , then said excuse me .
0 was told to wait by clerk passing on phone .
0 they ca n't find it .
0 but they are horribly unorganized and have serious customer service issues .
0 first off , when we called , we got the usual sales tactics .
0 sadly , his tactics worked .
0 it being around _num_ or 6pm , the place was utterly packed .
0 it was n't shabby looking , just broken in .
0 the clientele looks like a bunch of average joes .
0 the equipment is n't the latest and greatest .
0 we 're stuck with evening training sessions for the time being .
0 he did n't go over some of the basics of weight training .
0 luckily i knew them already .
0 my session was also about _num_ minutes short .
0 the first thing i noticed was the weird smell from the parking lot .
0 the entire building looked old and run down .
0 i did not get the same service .
0 the food selection was poor .
0 they only eggs they had were scrambled eggs and eggs sunny side up .
0 most of the items looked like they had been sitting out for a while .
0 also the bathroom was a _num_ out of _num_ in terms of cleanliness .
0 it smelled and looked liked it had not been cleaned that morning .
0 i drove by this place so many times and never noticed it .
0 sesame chicken was just ok .
0 egg roll was typical .
0 crab puff was typical .
0 they were very friendly and the food was hot .
0 she tells well too bad the delivery driver has left .
0 at this point i 'm thinking good because i am hungry .
0 _num_ minutes in i call back and just cancel my order .
0 this is the kind of bullshit that just doesnt need to happen .
0 the sad thing is in this economy they are struggling .
0 i guess in this economy pong pong can afford to lose customers .
0 shame on you pong pong .
0 yes i am pissed .
0 these days the quality is pretty lousy .
0 it feels like the owners have given up .
0 now it 's all bland mush .
0 the prices are pretty hard to beat , $ _num_ for two dinner combos !
0 first time and sadly enough last time .
0 very bland , i ca n't even finish my dish .
0 i ordered for _num_ people and none of them liked their food .
0 would think it could be just me , bit obviously not .
0 not to my taste .
0 grew up on real chinese food in california and this is not it .
0 quality of both beef and chicken seemed low grade .
0 fried won tons were not crispy .
0 no return experience for me .
0 i went in and it was empty .
0 i will never go here again unfortunately .
0 go behind the place and just roll down the window .
0 check out new asian kitchen they have much better food .
0 meh , was stuck in hotel and needed delivery .
0 chicken chow mien tastes like cheap hotel food .
0 not too mention the service is good , friendly n quick .
0 cheap lunch but the food was pretty bad .
0 the rice was as dry as the desert .
0 i will not be back .
0 oh well , i guess it 's my fault if i keep going back .
0 the curly fries were good , but the sliders was sub-par .
0 and the quality of food has really gone downhill as time has passed .
0 not `` the best of phoenix classics '' as the menu says .
0 made with processed turkey and ham .
0 wo n't come back again .
0 my entree , never get this .
0 tipped the bartender _num_ % on our to go meal and waited forever !
0 i waited over _num_ minutes .
0 she was n't very friendly ... did n't add to the experience .
0 i probably would have got that .
0 she comes back five min later with the wrong drink .
0 still no chips and salsa .
0 they really earned a _num_ .
0 i recently had drinks and food with friends here .
0 the service was awful !
0 it took over _num_ minutes to get my 2nd drink .
0 it ruined the calzone for me altogether .
0 i ordered _num_ wings on the bone .
0 _num_ suicide , _num_ hot , and _num_ pineapple teriyaki .
0 i understand this is n't her fault , but the restaurants .
0 the bill finally came , she had overcharged us for the calzone .
0 with waters and those meals the total was $ _num_ .
0 i tipped $ _num_ and got the hell out of there .
0 i would have given _num_ stars , but my stomach hurts now .
0 even through the first part of the _num_ 's it was old reliable .
0 what the hell happened ?
0 when i got my order , i recieved breaded wings .
0 when she came back , she seemed pissed and offered me another drink .
0 i have nearly _num_ years of customer service .
0 if you make an error , you do n't argue with your customer .
0 just apologize for the error and offer to fix it .
0 it was her fault that she failed to ask how i wanted the wings .
0 there was not very much pepperoni .
0 the exterior is worn .
0 the landscape is tired and needs help .
0 theres nothing inviting about the exterior of this restaurant at all .
0 the interior is worse .
0 deep fried breaded wings that turn to mush .
0 do not go to this place .
0 i was not offered a menu when i got there .
0 _num_ , _num_ other locations still open according to the sign .
0 very sketchy and somewhat dangerous .
0 i would advise anyone and everyone to avoid this safeway at all cost .
0 what a pain in the butt .
0 when i mean never i mean never .
0 in general it feels small and is usually empty for a reason .
0 why would anyone want to put their food in them ... yuck .
0 store is really dirty in general ; floors are gross and shelves disgusting .
0 then i went to buy sushi and the cashier was rude .
0 there is no way this place deserves five stars !
0 i am definitely not coming back .
0 the pizza looked and tasted like it had been sitting out for an hour .
0 the wings were still hot but unfortunately not as tasteful as they looked .
0 my brother sister and i were immediately sick after eating here .
0 the staff was n't the friendliest .
0 with no care in the world !
0 that was a complete waste of time and money .
0 the `` hoagie '' had disgusting processed ham on them .
0 come on , _num_ $ for a hoagie `` meal '' with processed meat .
0 also the slice specials , were simply cheese .
0 i always try the current _num_ dollar burger special they have .
0 i fully agree with amanda b. on this one .
0 overall , mediocre at best .
0 this to me is just rude and completely unprofessional .
0 he didnt even offer an apology , he just turned around and walked away .
0 i think thats about it for me and king gyro .
0 i dont think you should treat your customers that way .
0 stay away , theres many more places that appreciate there customers .
0 do not go here , they are unprofessional and rude .
0 this to me is not the way to run a business .
0 damn rude if you ask me .
0 this place and i will not recommend it to anyone .
0 makes me wonder if the lost business was worth going home _num_ minutes early .
0 he told me he remembered me and apologized for being closed .
0 this place has the worst greek food i 've ever tasted .
0 on the positive side , the lettuce was green and was as expected .
0 seriously , the only thing they got right was the lettuce .
0 do yourself a favor and try another place for greek food .
0 it costs them more for frys then it does for lettuce and tomato .
0 every other gyros place i 've been to will substitute .
0 we ordered our food and sat down .
0 that 's the main reason i did n't give them _num_ star .
0 the tzatziki sauce did n't taste right .
0 i found it greasy and bland .
0 they were soggy , so i did n't eat any of them .
0 overnight i see that the price has gone up a dollar .
0 as far as the food goes , i think the gyros are pretty decent .
0 too much spanish here .
0 employees are loud and obnoxious .
0 this was the worst del taco ever !
0 the chips in the nachos were totally stale .
0 the fries were cold and the service was very mediocre !
0 being from out of town and getting such poor food was so disappointing !
0 bad bad bad customer service .
0 stopped by for soda after being at the hobby shop next door .
0 when i pulled up i gave her my debit card .
0 the head clerk asked me not to talk this way to the clerk .
0 i 've been to drive thru windows that play games with charges before .
0 but , no more .
0 we could not use our only sink for over a day .
0 we left our phone number for nathan , the manager , to call us .
0 terrible beds , cheap fabrics , made for a difficult .
0 possible bed bugs , i woke with numerous bites on me .
0 but , as for security , it was a bit sketchy .
0 guy at the counter was nice , only plus .
0 the room was terrible - filthy .
0 this place is cheap and it 's obvious why when you get there .
0 burn marks in the comforter .
0 filthy windows , and various other strange smells i could n't recognize .
0 who is giving this place more than _num_ star ?
0 i was an awful stay here .
0 low water pressure from the shower .
0 bed springs were broken on the bed .
0 i would not bring a car rental here .
0 the only good thing was the bed !
0 when we told her we had a reservation she was not happy .
0 so we get to our room ... ... ew .
0 it is so disgusting in there .
0 they did n't even wipe down the sink ?
0 well as soon as we walked in , it was a joke !
0 i will not recommend this place because of the lack of care .
0 sorry red roof , just was n't a pleasant stay .
0 bowling is fun but they all are so dull and blah inside .
0 now there making no money from _num_ till midnight .
0 she could have done something but no .
0 but it was dead in there .
0 well , that is a sorry excuse .
0 since their visit , the only scorpions we 've seen were dead !
0 i wear acrylic on my big toes and i needed a fill .
0 she was lost on what to do .
0 she was clueless on how to shape them .
0 then when it came time to paint them , it was a complete nightmare .
0 needless to say , i will never patron this location again .
0 some employees there have n't received their benefit packet and/or new hire paperwork !
0 even after the _num_ day hire .
0 this place is horrible .
0 they are bad news , especially their administration side .
0 and only then was i told where my check was .
0 nothing to write home about .
0 this place has the worst service of any bar i 've ever been in .
0 however , the staff has gone downhill .
0 nope and hell no thank you .
0 ps : bartender of _num_ years !
0 wo n't go back .
0 i was very disappointed with the quality & service .
0 i asked them what their delivery fee was , they said $ _num_ .
0 when i picked up the order , i was given another totally different price .
0 they still did n't care .
0 it 's no wonder why people prefer to go to buffets .
0 , something happened , not good anymore .
0 i 'm trying to walk off on a bill for $ _num_ ?
0 talk about bad customer service .
0 another badly managed chinese restaurant that ca n't cook .
0 first off , i found them to be a tad expensive .
0 the rice was bland and the pork was an odd color .
0 the chicken fried rice was also bland .
0 there are no veggies mixed in nor any meat .
0 the egg foo young looked like chicken and veggies in a thin brown sauce .
0 the taste did not disappoint in that area .
0 the best thing i ate was the fortune cookie ... .
0 i will not be ordering from this place again .
0 i literally live _num_ mins from this place .
0 this is not how you treat customers .
0 but let this story begin at noon today .
0 first time ordering from here ... _num_ entrees and soup cost over $ _num_ !
0 and it was n't that great .
0 the orange chicken was very soggy and super sweet .
0 they make their own eggrolls , but they were n't that good .
0 the beef in the beef broccoli was average and the broccoli was mushy .
0 the sweet & sour chicken was average .
0 really was some of the worst chinese food i 've ever had .
0 sorry will not be back .
0 not a single person came or left the _num_ minutes we were there .
0 i ordered a spicy chicken dish , asked no soy to be on it .
0 half the reason i wanted asian food was for the spice .
0 however the chicken was like gum .
0 ended up driving through taco bell on the way home , very irritated .
0 absolutely will not be back .
0 right now we 've got apps , soup and entrees - too fast !
0 had a touch of heat , but you also need the sour .
0 the highlight of our meal was the potstickers with dipping sauce .
0 these were pretty good , however i prefer them steamed to fried .
0 i really hate to give restaurant a less then favorable review .
0 however , the food just was n't that good .
0 the pork and chicken lo mein was very greasy and tasteless .
0 the vegetables were overcooked and soggy .
0 when going here for lunch my food was sub-par .
0 it tasted like leftover food and had very little flavor .
0 i did not come in expecting much and i left dissatisfied .
0 first time here ; tonight for dinner .
0 the service leaves little to be desired .
0 our server was n't pleasant at all .
0 before tonight 's meal , i would 've easily given _num_ stars .
0 however , our meal ( while delicious ) , gave me horrible food poisoning .
0 me and the boyfriend did not like the food as much .
0 the chow mein was very mushy and had weird texture .
0 the pot stickers were hard like a rock .
0 the rice was cold and not fresh as it seems like .
0 nope , no customer service .
0 worst customer service ever .
0 not accommodating at all .
0 the manager has zero sense of urgency or compassion .
0 took my suv there to get the air fixed which stopped blowing .
0 it held a vacuum , there was no leak .
0 they lost me as a customer .
0 lots of bad reviews about the same stuff .
0 most every morning they mess up my coffee !
0 ca n't beat the price though .
0 i had them fix it and they apologized with an apple pie .
0 are you freaking kidding me ?
0 the service was pretty fast but the food was awful .
0 fucking slow , _num_ cars in the drive through and been here _num_ minutes .
0 clean , but super slow .
0 the cashiers are super slow at taking orders and getting food orders out .
0 this drive-thru is so slow !
0 i sat in line _num_ minutes for a hot coffee .
0 i do n't really care for avenue 's clothes .
0 i found a pair at _num_ % off immediately .
0 and he just hung out ... .
0 she seemed put out and came up and rang me out .
0 all in all ... just strange .
0 debit card , this place need to get with it .
0 it 's a sunday night it was n't even busy .
0 no silverware in the bag .
0 one star because there is no zero star ... .
0 i stopped in for chicken this week .
0 i can not say thanks for the experience , truly disappointed .
0 kfc used to be one of my favorite places .
0 in time their lousy customer service will catch up .
0 was told they did n't have potato wedges .
0 they let me substitute a side item for it which was ok .
0 does n't get my biscuit or my soda .
0 sounds like incompetent management and poorly trained staff .
0 no customer service ... and then nothing but disrespect .
0 i 've talked the manager before & they act like they do n't care .
0 it really is n't rocket science .
0 you even read back to me what i ordered then again when i pay .
0 i should 've known better .
0 they got it wrong again .
0 i 'm paying a lot of money for the wrong order .
0 i would give _num_ stars .
0 got the order completely wrong .
0 left stuff out of the bag that they charged me for .
0 i had ordered _num_ family meals with _num_ extra biscuits .
0 after i paid they told me they did n't have enough biscuits .
0 they advised me another _num_ minutes .
0 this was a little frustrating but i let it go .
0 so after doing that , did she finally acknowledge me standing at the counter ?
0 shame on you , villa !
0 last time i visited the staff was horrible .
0 the chicken was frozen and nasty .
0 no eye contact , very short with me , just generally angry .
0 tl ; dr : foods good , depressing environment .
0 like they are doing you a favor by being open .
0 when we walked in we were ignored for a good few minutes .
0 customer service in this day and age is truly a lost art .
0 unfortunately the people running villa deli lost it a long time ago .
0 tons of sandwich places around with better attitudes , and better food .
0 now they purchase them and they are like day old chewy hamburger buns .
0 chewy , tasteless pieces of bread .
0 they no longer bake their own bread .
0 the new owner has an attitude problem .
0 from what i witnessed , she would n't let her employees take orders .
0 i should have just left at that point .
0 small portion of meat and again rude and seemed irritated to be working .
0 tables were dirty and we were the only customers in the restaurant .
0 wo n't be back .
0 sad what has happened to this sandwich shop .
0 business _num_ class might help his lady .
0 the bread was mediocre .
0 very skimpy with lettuce , tomatoes , peppers , etc .
0 unfortunately , we also ordered cannoli .
0 it was runny , thin , flat and no chocolate chips or anything .
0 that garbage at least has better consistency and taste .
0 i 'm just angry that i threw away almost $ _num_ .
0 no attempt was made to remove it .
0 please do n't waste your money !
0 it is not clean and i even pointed out a cockroach out to them .
0 not very professional and merely sub par .
0 if i could i 'd give this zero stars .
0 worst _num_ 1/2 hrs .
0 everytime i go in there ... there 's only one person .
0 a haircut , manicure , facial and a follow up haircut .
0 my facial was like _num_ minutes long and i could n't even relax .
0 i am the owner of devine 's .
0 you can not respond and when you contact yelp , you get no answer .
0 so therefore , i am assuming that these people do not exist .
0 well , the groupon was for $ _num_ .
0 it cost me an extra $ _num_ for the gel french manicure .
0 also ... the normal price for a pedicure is $ _num_ .
0 this was in no way worth $ _num_ .
0 nothing special about it , no hot towels , hot stones , etc .
0 tastes like just bread .
0 was n't good at all .
0 i was craving the classic : plain bagel toasted with plain cream cheese .
0 the bagel itself was the big disappointment .
0 as one reviewer pointed out , it tasted like bread .
0 but a big disappointment with the bagels .
0 for now , there 's nothing to bring me back .
0 not the best service i 've ever had .
0 i 've worked in food business and that 's not acceptable .
0 will not be returning .
0 the fried clams were horrible .
0 the only plus was that they were not strips .
0 the batter is terrible as well .
0 can i give zero stars ?
0 everything just lacked flavor .
0 heck , i 'd even take some salt .
0 the breading on the clams was a little better , but still flavorless .
0 if i could give negative stars i would .
0 when i was _num_ .
0 i have to agree with everything chad f said .
0 the clams were tender but the tartar sauce was horrible .
0 the food was overpriced for the quality and terrible .
0 save yourself a trip , do n't go here .
0 their batter is not very good at all .
0 old , dusty , very tired decor .
0 time to pick this mess up and take it into _num_ .
0 the chowder was so-so .
0 however for the portion you get it in pretty expensive .
0 i have had better chowder at a lower price .
0 i would n't recommend women walk across the parking lot alone .
0 i looked for the crab , there was none .
0 why do the seem to disappoint once you 've raved about them ?
0 went on saturday for lunch and the dining area was not to busy .
0 my rating is based off of food quality .
0 we had dinner here tonight and it was just average .
0 i do not like that so did not get any .
0 my friend said it was not good at all .
0 our server was very nice but she got basic things wrong .
0 a diet coke turned into an ice tea and she figured the bill wrong .
0 a big , '' no , no '' for me .
0 so needless to say , avoid this place at all cost .
0 she came over and was rude from the start .
0 the entire experience in dealing with her was horrible .
0 she did n't even clear our plates at the end of our meal .
0 she then told me that not all the candies was for me to take .
0 the supervisor did n't even seemed shocked that i was complaining .
0 i did n't want to know about her personal life or excuses .
0 don then asked me what i want done !
0 i left the conversation even more frustrated and disappointed .
0 they probably have good fried food but anything else is just not good .
0 horrible is being nice .
0 they were bitter , strong and tasted old .
0 they were also soggy and seemed under cooked .
0 it looked and tasted like it came from a box .
0 again tasting strong and very fishy , obviously not fresh and home made .
0 needless to say , it just sat there .
0 what i remembered was nothing like that .
0 the fries were the only thing i ate .
0 not much changed inside in _num_ years except for the food .
0 we probably will never come back because of the disappointment of this experience .
0 _num_ customers and one waitress ?
0 then it grew to _num_ customers and one waitress .
0 we ordered chowder and fried cod , with fries and coleslaw .
0 the chowder was n't very tasteful it very bland .
0 am here for only a few days soooo sad .
0 will not go back .
0 do not go through the drive through .
0 went there last saturday and waited _num_ minutes in line at the drive through .
0 never any apologies and what 's worst no one seemed to care .
0 giving this location _num_ star only because yelp required it to post my review .
0 they always apologize about the wait and yet do nothing to fix it .
0 shift manager was an asshole .
0 i tried paying with my debit card and unfortunately it was declined .
0 the worst burger king i ever been to !
0 its empty for a reason and the employees seem careless .
0 service is slow even if your the only customer .
0 of all people the owner is who treated us poorly .
0 instead he takes the opportunity to practice his sit-down comedy act i guess .
0 a business that treats a potential customer like that wo n't get my business .
0 i did get my one concern covered , but barely got examined .
0 i 'll probably just switch doctors all together .
0 avoid this clinic at all costs !
0 at _num_ am i was still waiting to be seen .
0 she was however very understanding and caring .
0 when we arrived , there were _num_ other people in the entire place .
0 especially when there are only _num_ people in the whole restaurant .
0 ca n't this conversation wait until you are off work ?

0 employees are always rude too .
0 they 're always loose and stuff falls out .
0 i ordered one thing today around _num_ with no line in the drive through .
0 i ordered a bean burrito no cheese .
0 i guess not a good day to visit this location .
0 i 'll be buying else where from now on .
0 i mean , i 've never done this before .
0 what he should have asked me was what is the painting company 's name .
0 by this time i was annoyed with jerry and his surly attitude .
0 he 's an old guy who probably does n't want to be working .
0 do yourself a favor ... avoid jerry .
0 i am not happy leaving this place !
0 it 's more like `` the bad egg '' !

0 this was just _num_ of the items on my list .
0 is she not wanting to deal with me ?
0 in the beginning , i will admit that i was satisfied .
0 they made me believe all was in good standing .
0 if i could have given no starts i would .
0 stating it needed additional cleaning for one .
0 ah no i do n't think so .
0 since there is no option for zero stars then i 'll choose just _num_ .
0 we picked up our keys after dropping off all of our move in money .
0 i emailed over copies of the receipts for the carpet cleaning .
0 their receptionist was rude .
0 the wright house has soooo much potential , but they fail big time .
0 the reception hall and bridal suite on the other hand is a joke .
0 after being completely blown off for weeks , i give up .
0 we 'll find someone else to work with and give our money too .

0 an hour and a half to serve four people mediocre food ?
0 the chimis were less than good , with absolutely no seasonings for the meat .
0 the food was mediocre ( if not lacking ) and the service was awful .
0 only a few chips and out of the bottle salsa for starters ?

0 then , took another _num_ minutes to get chips , salsa and a drink .
0 eggs were undercooked and the sauce was thin and tasteless .

0 well sunday was even worse .
0 that fell very flat too today unfortunately .
0 our waitress was horrible .
0 first time & will be our last time .

0 you wo n't regret it .
0 my mother ordered a hot dog and it was microwaved .

0 this is no way to run a business .
0 very sad to learn that as i loved the place .
0 i should n't have to track you down to find this out .
0 shocked , i replied `` because i wan na take a class . ''
0 so one day , i convinced her to stop in and try it .

0 the service part person was rude and had a bad attitude .
0 shame on you camping world !

0 worst customer service ever .
0 if there was a negative star .

0 no problem we will put a rush on it .
0 i do n't know how they stay in business .
0 do n't waste your time !
0 this review is for the service dept .
0 now i see why their average rating on google is _num_ star .
0 of course , the call did not come , and i continue to inquire .
0 get everything in writing and write down who takes your call .
0 the place for starters has no feeling of arrival .
0 the chips were the only good part of my meal .
0 not as many mushrooms though .
0 i really have tried to give this restaurant a shot .
0 literally two minutes from my old home and we were desperate .
0 the place was totally empty at like 8pm on a friday night .
0 what horrible customer service !
0 the lighting was dim making it hard to read the menu .
0 food was decent , service was terrible .
0 we all ordered different food and it was all disgusting .

0 very disappointed in this restaurant .
0 i was looking forward to a salad and she some mexican food .
0 when we walked in there was a wait in the dining room .

0 for the owner to be so blatantly rude is inexcusable !
0 _num_ or _num_ people are at the bar .
0 our waiter was too busy covering what looked like the entire restaurant .
0 the biggest problem we had was service .
0 if the food had been outstanding , maybe i 'd try again .
0 the food was so-so and very over priced for what you get .
0 i had the high desert pasta and there was barely anything in the bowl .
0 no lettuce , pico , nothing but chicken .
0 my stacked enchilada was essentially the same too , lots of chicken and cheese .
0 i have no idea why people are rating this place so highly !
0 it looked like some kind of hollandaise sauce .
0 but unfortunately it was the same steak i just sent back .
0 my families dinners were also horrible .
0 when i left i looked and there were _num_ patio tables empty and clean .
0 she said she 'd be back and disappeared for a few minutes .
0 and it was n't an inexpensive visit either .
0 run , run as fast as you can away from this place .
0 booked appointment online waste of time .
0 called and made an appointment to get my tire repaired .
0 he then went into a hard sales pitch about getting a new tire .
0 waste of time , will never go back there or any discount tire again .
0 they did n't even bother to try filling my tire with air .
0 they found every reason in the book not to honor it .
0 this literally ruined my day .
0 annoying and i would not recommend .
0 mesa , az _num_ and they honored the warranty with no problems at all !
0 friendly staff but disappointing visit .
0 just to make money of my ass ... .
0 will probably never buy tires from discount tire again .
0 guess he did n't think i could come up with the paperwork .
0 fyi , free work is usually cheap work .
0 this message is to warning everybody who go here !
0 awful , awful , awful .
0 do n't repeat my mistake .
0 there are around five entrees , rice and noodles .
0 i was dragged here and was not interested ... .
0 nothing has been done to improve the look of the place .
0 this is quite frankly one of the most disgusting chinese buffets i have visited .

0 they do n't really have variety of selections to choose from .
0 their chow mein was super dry .
0 the place was too small and had too much flies in it .
0 none of their food was hot when ordered .
0 this place is just awful .
0 i would n't recommend it to anyone .
0 was ill for a few hours .
0 if you 're looking for quality chinese food you are in the wrong place .
0 lovely staff and a one service .
0 limited variety but for $ _num_ it was fine .
0 this is not gourmet chinese food .
0 gourmet chinese food would be $ _num_ for one entree plus tax and tip .
0 wontons were not greasy .
0 did not like orange or lemon chicken because of the thick , thick crust .
0 this place was awful !
0 the only item was able to eat was the soggy broccoli beef !
0 the orange chicken was more bread then chicken and let alone zero orange flavor !
0 the worst chinese buffet ever .
0 the buffet is about _num_ feet long .
0 it was $ _num_ without a drink and it was worth about $ _num_ .
0 i should 've looked at the buffet before i paid .
0 so for that aspect its part my fault .
0 i do n't know how this place stays in business .
0 it was lunch and it was dead .
0 never got the craps afterwards but that was a surprise .
0 probably because i ate half my plate and left early .
0 do n't eat here .
0 i also told him i would leave him some good feedback online .
0 minor detail but it could easily be fixed .
0 i asked if they had replaced the spare and he told me no .
0 it was one of the worst experiences i have ever had with a store .
0 so i ordered my tires online , scheduled an appointment for two days out .
0 but in the mean time , they would not give me my car .
0 i do n't want a hug .
0 no salt , overcooked and stiff .
0 i could n't even eat them .
0 i agree with two of the other reviewers - this place is horrible .
0 it was over deep fried and crispy - almost brick like .
0 dingy , dark , dirty , sticky -- that 's your table .
0 greasy , unappealing , low quality -- that 's your food .
0 the beans and rice were overcooked and tasteless .
0 were bothered by it and walked out .
0 it is the typical old school sonoran mexican joint .
0 well , it 's not authentic mexican food , but authentic old fashioned tex-mex .
0 old lounge style atmosphere , kind of tired , but service was good .
0 there 's just too many other good choices out there .
0 girlfriend wanted mexican food and not just a regular run to taco bell .
0 service was fine but the decor seems or rather is very outdated .
0 just wo n't be mine .
0 the rice had dried out pieces from the microwave .
0 i was so mad that i paid for horrendous food .

0 my new rating is zero .
0 i just walked out .
0 the food was mediocre at best .
0 the beef and chicken tastes almost the same .
0 the salsa was not good .
0 not sure what , but it was missing something !
0 but that was probably the only plus !
0 a little pricy for just one and that had no beans or rice with .
0 i also failed to mention that they have no kids menus !
0 hell id even take taco bell over this highly priced , awful establishment !
0 large quantities , but too salty and the tamale was almost nothing but breading .
0 what little filling there was was significantly over the spiced .
0 beef enchilada was also extremely salty , cheese enchilada was very good .
0 i would like to have the drinks shortly after the chips and salsa .
0 he did n't take time to listen to what the patient wanted .

0 but i wo n't be coming back .
0 my friends and i stopped at rosa 's for lunch after golf .
0 however , i ordered my spinach enchiladas as it is usually good .
0 however this time it was not the same .
0 his attitude was `` your tough luck '' if you do n't like it .
0 he was rude and does not belong in the food service industry .
0 perhaps the management of this location need to be looked at by the owner .
0 suggested by someone we met and did not live up to the hype .
0 chicken was dry dry dry .
0 the corn tortillas were sooo dry and chewy .
0 beef was flavorless like it was n't seasoned .

0 they are of no value to anyone else but are priceless to me .
0 i too have lost several hundred family slides due to this business closing .
0 the staff has always been pretty unhelpful and sometimes very pushy with sales .
0 the decor is bland and depressing and has n't changed in years .
0 he 's rude and ca n't cut hair well at all .
0 a simple yes or no would have done .
0 downfall , prices are ridiculous and they only take returns from their own location .
0 this grandma only offered me .
0 its not just about science here , its about taste .
0 unfortunately grandma did n't have that either .
0 i would not recommend grandma 's kitchen to people with young children .
0 it is supposed to be a kid friendly restaurant .
0 i admit my son 's ages _num_ and _num_ were a little noisy .
0 but i did not appreciate being told to keep my children quite .
0 i 've visited several times for both breakfast and lunch .
0 overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .
0 i wish them luck .
0 his omelet was so-so , and my oatmeal was watery and possibly instant .
0 the toast was good , but that 's not a shock .
0 the seating area is crowded with furniture that obviously does n't suit the space .
0 the worst part of the restaurant is the service .
0 on our second visit , we met grandma .
0 shame on you , grandma .
0 do n't waste the trip .
0 the decor was pretty solid and had a country feel .
0 there was no review of the specials or the daily quiche availability .
0 the sausage patties were pretty good but kinda thin .
0 moldy bread was served then replaced .
0 been coming here for years ... need that clean loving country grandma feel back .
0 food decent , atmosphere is nonexistent !
0 i went here with my father in law and my _num_ year old daughter .
0 the atmosphere was so-so , they should have had music on or something !
0 the waitress was n't mean or rude , just kinda surly .
0 some what cheap food .
0 negative _num_ stars for the poor garage staff .
0 did they fix the problem ?
0 the night person was the complete opposite .
0 this is my second one star review on yelp and they deserve it .
0 my jack and coke was seriously lacking .
0 very clean place but just no ambiance .
0 the pool sticks were in terrible condition and were n't straight in the slightest .
0 on top of that , the service was terrible .
0 other than that , we did n't see her at all .
0 if that 's your thing , then go for it .
0 i ordered _num_ wings and _num_ breasts ( paying extra mind you ) .
0 a complete waste of money .
0 the service here is the worst .
0 i am extremely disappointed with this location .
0 the only good thing in our combo meals was the warm cookie .
0 this location served uncooked chicken tenders .
0 served me raw chicken .
0 horrible just horrible never again .
0 this was _num_ years ago .
0 this place is a total dump and ripoff .
0 if you are a disabled veteran do not even think about moving in there .
0 upstairs and within a few days my husband was bit by bed bugs .
0 which i really do n't care about .
0 its the health and safety of my daughter and husband i care about .
0 and the average age of people there when i visited was probably _num_ .
0 not something i 'd take junior to do .
0 look ... i 'm sorry ... but i just do n't get it .
0 would i want to repeat it again ?
0 the experience was super extremely terrible for me .
0 this was seriously was a waste of money and scary experience for me .
0 i freakin almost died here .
0 is this place even legit cause you can only pay cash of $ _num_ ?
0 does the state really even know about this place ?
0 i called the phone number and the bus driver answered the phone .
0 monday came and went with no phone call .
0 that 's how you get repeat and referral business .
0 salt river bus is not a reputable company .
0 the other _num_ should really just wear a normal suit .
0 but i wouldnt want to take my niece and nephew .
0 we did n't even get to go down the river .
0 waste of time , waste of a day , horrible customer service .
0 make no mistake , this is a booze cruise and is not family friendly .
0 who knows , it might have been .
0 the bottom is lined with cans .
0 no glass is allowed .
0 high prices and poor customer service .
0 completely disappointing disgusting experience .
0 cash only business , no mention of this on website .
0 not my type of fun .
0 this would have been true customer service even in a hard situation .
0 it 's not pretty walking through the river without a shoe on .
0 probably from the 70s and obviously not maintained !
0 the tube they rent are a joke !
0 you will most likely sink if you lightly bump against a river rock .
0 it 's cluttered with beer cans and the smell of dead fish !
0 also bring a cell phone and most importantly , `` your own tube '' !
0 it sounded like fun but fell a little short of expectations .
0 they had lots of friendly staff on hand to check everyone in .
0 they should n't use precious ac space for storage !
0 on the tag , needless to say i was disappointed .
0 wo n't be returning .
0 when i am in the neighborhood i stop in and i am always disappointed .
0 i do n't know why i bother going here .
0 way back when , we looked into destination weddings with a aaa az branch .
0 a month passes by and we find out that rep was fired .
0 things went sour from there .
0 we hardly ever received return phone calls on time .
0 unfortunately , it was n't that easy .
0 we would 've saved ourselves a boat load of stress by doing it ourselves .
0 i 've been a aaa customer for _num_ years in multiple states .
0 is n't this the job of a travel agent ?
0 our travel agent did not assist a single one in booking .
0 this was june 1st .
0 we were very disappointed .
0 he was rude and not explain well why he did not change .
0 i believe if he did nothing wrong , he can show me his id .
0 he was totally jerk .
0 i was not happy with their mobile battery service .
0 i am disappointed in this aaa service .
0 this is not what i expect when i buy my yearly membership .
0 this mobile battery truck is not service i trust .
0 they declined , and were told again they really should have the battery replaced .
0 it may be that you do not need a new battery .
0 unfortunately when i need az aaa they let me down .
0 they said it was the battery , and replaced my battery .
0 because come to find _num_ days later , it is not the battery .
0 anyway , i ca n't express enough how much i hate this place .
0 this is a prime destination of american tourists .
0 late _num_ i had an experience that was just horrific with aaa .
0 i 'd purchased a aaa battery and just _num_ months later started having issues .
0 bad job kathy ... bad job .
0 i ca n't go to _num_ stars yet .
0 tell me how you can help me not how you ca n't .
0 so disappointed with aaa .
0 had to walk three miles to purchase a battery in _num_ plus weather !
0 i wish i could rate them negative stars .
0 we have been loyal aaa customers for over _num_ years .
0 today they literally hung me out to dry .
0 it was a simple battery replacement that turned into a nightmare .
0 meanwhile i 'm waiting for an answer .
0 thus leaving me stranded in the dark alone .
0 therefore i ca n't write a letter of complaint .
0 aaa , this is an insulting way to treat your members .
0 waited _num_ minutes for a passport pic and no one else was in line !
0 i was _num_ hours late for work .
0 i am going to call my insurance company and get towing through them .
0 customer service is what is lacking though , hence the two stars .
0 no one working here goes really goes out of their way to be friendly .
0 it really felt like we were bothering him .
0 i have never felt so unwelcome in a business .
0 never acknowledged that we were there .
0 gave me a form to fill out and sat back down .
0 never opened the case , never explained the rental terms .
0 want pickles on your sandwich ?
0 employee taking order was short and rude .
0 i dunno ... was not feeling it at all .
0 this sandwich was to not have lettuce or tomatoes on it .
0 i trimmed away so much bread that had meat nowhere by it .
0 the pickle was really soggy too .
0 not a good value and portions have been reduced .
0 will not come here again .
0 if i had more than _num_ items i would n't have noticed .
0 some of us prefer to use that because the staff stinks .
0 it makes it seem like no customer service training is given for any employees .
0 had a horrible experience today .
0 it 's not even worth that new !
0 is that even meat in the _num_ cent tacos ?
0 the woman did n't even apologize .
0 if that 's your thing , this is your place .
0 takeout porterhouse steak was way undercooked , like half raw .
0 unfortunately by the time i found out i was miles away .
0 i 'm still waiting for the outback manager to get back to me .
0 we caught this outback serving reheated coconut shrimp tonight !
0 the server repeated my order .
0 the manager apologized and said she would take my meal off of our ticket .
0 my daughter finished her meal , we left , i did not eat mine .
0 could not wait for them to try to get it right .
0 i do n't know , but i remember outback being better .
0 still , management did nothing to comp the clientele .
0 i just cant get my taste buds around it .
0 i tried several different steaks and was sorely disappointed every time .
0 the onion gets _num_ stars .
0 it 's obvious it was stale .
0 why would you even bring that out to me ?
0 after hearing the list of choices i chose one .
0 what was left was literally _num_ small bites .
0 the prime rib had no flavor .
0 the chocolate desert was good .
0 our appetizer was a greasy mess and our entrees were small and disappointing .
0 blooming onion was a grease pit .
0 the burger was over cooked and dry .
0 it also had a tomato but instead of a nice red slice of tomato .
0 the waiter acted like he could not be bothered with the complaint .
0 it was difficult to get refills on drinks .
0 the manager acted like he did n't care .
0 why has this chain not closed yet with its 19th ' menu .
0 i do n't even know where to begin .
0 the food at outback is mediocre at best .
0 mahi mahi is dry .
0 left to have dinner elsewhere .
0 the manager was the only good thing about this location .
0 server was rude especially to my husband .
0 i will not be going to this location again .
0 not as good as it used to be .
0 this use to be my favorite place to eat .
0 more then ruth chris or any of the high end places i 've experienced .
0 this is been one of the worst experiences ever in a restaurant .
0 you need to print it off before going to the restaurant .
0 no instructions on the email .
0 gave up and left full payment .
0 never could use our gift card .
0 worst outback in the chain !
0 service and food were awful .
0 i agree with marcus s. just close the place already !
0 fridays & weekends , open for lunch .
0 was not offered bread .
0 soup , salad , drinks , all served at the same time .
0 not for our table though .
0 i left hungry after ordering _num_ courses and sending the main entre back .
0 the food was a disaster and everything looked like a punch in the stomach .
0 overall this place is not the spot for food .
0 it is with much regret that i give a _num_ star review .
0 too much wrong to list ... just skip this one .
0 this location is closed and probably will be forever .
0 horrible customer service , out of bread , out of meat .
0 take these few reviews as a bad sign and keep looking !
0 the framing was a mess !
0 the customer service is not good .
0 it 's just not a good experience .
0 there 's really no other way to explain it ... just ... not good .
0 it took too long and no one seemed to know what was going on .
0 our home building through them has been a nightmare .
0 one broken thing after another they do n't care to address .
0 hell wo n't take her because she gives them a bad name .
0 if i could give zero stars i would !
0 i got my car towed down the street _num_ blocks .
0 cold food , no flavor , and crappy service .
0 the person at serrano 's told me the price was _num_ !
0 went during lunch time and serve was extremely slow .
0 we had some margaritas - overly sweet and completely forgettable .
0 the fish was overcooked , and the other flavors blended into a mush .
0 everything else was just okay .
0 makes you wonder if they bother tasting anything first .
0 not the best , but certainly not the worst place in town .
0 i would have given this place _num_ stars prior to the recent experiences .
0 the new menu is horrible and does not work .
0 the new menu is confusing and the selection is too small .
0 it also tasted bland .
0 i miss the old food , menu and ambiance .

0 stopped in to meet my wife for lunch .
0 we were not impressed by the food at all .
0 then i got ants in my pants waiting and i went to the bar .
0 one bite would be medium , the next would be very spicy .
0 i usually go to the jiffy lube off chandler which provides great efficient service .
0 this place is why yelp should allow zero stars .
0 i was driving by today at lunch and saw the tanning sign .
0 ok , but there is no green button .
0 got ready and saw _num_ minutes on the timer , good to go .
0 hit the green button and ... nothing .

0 never again will i bring my child here not even for her follow up .
0 i worked with a women named tracy and she was rude and very inconsiderate !
0 she spoke very rudely to my daughter and she was _num_ .
0 my daughter was in tears and didnt even want to see the doctor .
0 see a blonde named sam , stay away !
0 the office staff is even worse .
0 it was worse than dealing with my ex wife .
0 whatever you do do n't rent here .
0 whoever orders for health and beauty sucks and should be fired .
0 do n't see it adding anything to the overhead other than a juice machine .
0 i do not recommend bringing a young person here .
0 she went on and on and on about how horrible her nails look .
0 she was rude the whole time and rushed through my pedicure and nails .

0 they just want money .

0 also , he has one nurse practitioner who i can not stand !
0 the receptionist are rude and impatient .
0 i have never been allowed to see a dr in a timely manner .

0 i was very disappointed and will not be returning .
0 it was soggy for starters .
0 and after a few bites i realized the dough was still raw .
0 like sticky dough , uncooked .
0 i was very disappointed and will not be returning .
0 i 'll still visit sport clips , just not this location .
0 they took my name and number instead and promised to get back to me .
0 we 'll see if that happens , but i 'm not holding my breath .
0 i 'm tired of the bait and switch .
0 when i showed up for my appointment there was no record of the appointment .
0 the owner was not available .
0 i will never go back , i would suggest others to do the same !
0 went for my appt and was there for hours .
0 very frustrating especially when you are paying a pretty penny !
0 not including the aggravation of dealing with their poor customer service .
0 i am in for an oil change and some other service related items .
0 : ( i wish i could give negative stars .
0 while we were there , we asked about getting some new keys cut .
0 the guy at the parts counter said they could n't cut those keys .
0 why does the dealer think we have bags of money ?
0 probably going to report them to a consumer protection agency .
0 would never use again .
0 absolutely the worst dealership i 've ever been to .
0 and they said they would give me a $ _num_ gift card .
0 avoid this place at all costs .
0 so yes i get it , i took a risk buying a used car .
0 i wish i could give it zero stars .
0 bob her ... in the service department was arrogant and rude .
0 car was needed again for factory recall on a part .
0 i 'm finally writing a review , this is the last straw .
0 i do n't know how i can trust this dealership .
0 horrible craftsmanship , terrible business ethics and customer service .
0 worse service i have ever been to !
0 are you kidding me ?
0 this is _num_ % true .
0 i would give _num_ stars if i could .
0 worst customer service i have ever had .
0 no one asked what i needed help with .
0 my experience was frustrating and a poor one .
0 was very disappointed by the customer service .
0 we came in and nothing of ours was done .
0 improve your customer service , and you should probably get some different employees .
0 i 've interacted with two employees during my two visits here .
0 customers are not your children .
0 i 'd give them _num_ stars if it was an option .
0 too much work for them obviously !
0 they obvious are n't environment friendly !
0 horrible service and lies about how they do things .
0 teach your employees customer service skills .
0 maybe you could have customers take a number to stay organized .
0 this is not his fault .
0 it seems like a group problem .
0 i was told my service would take _num_ minutes .
0 i finally approached the desk , he looked at me and walked away .
0 no `` i will be right with you '' , nothing .
0 they all looked at me and did nothing .
0 it would be nice if there was a nicer waiting area and better lighting .
0 ordered pecan chicken salad .
0 ordered the classic beef sandwich and arby fries to go .
0 the fries were terrible , over cooked and greasy .
0 wo n't make this mistake again .
0 it was an ok place .
0 we probably wo n't be returning .
0 absolutely no idea how this place got rated _num_ stars .
0 first off , it 's not a restaurant .
0 ordered one drink then got the hell out .
0 not very friendly at all , in not the nicest neighborhood in mesa .
0 and this week i am very , very upset .
0 the haircut that i got is in no way what i clearly asked for .
0 so i ordered _num_ honey bbq wings from this place .
0 heidi answers and says ok we will cancel the order for the wings .
0 the plus side is that i was offered new wings free of charge .
0 to send me wings without any sauce whatsoever is just ridiculous .
0 especially when my receipt reads `` _num_ boneless honey bbq . ''
0 mistakes happen , but this was no mistake .
0 barro 's started making the wings and did n't want to waste them .
0 i placed a call in order .
0 thanks for the total lack of customer service barro 's .
0 if that is the case , we 're all in trouble .
0 ok , now this place is n't looking too good .
0 unfortunately , things only got worse from here .
0 safe to say i will b paying them off and finding a nicer dentist .
0 even if it does cost me a little more .
0 commercial dentistry with no heart .
0 stay far away from here !
0 the selection of things was n't that impressive .
0 nothing to burn sage in , and the stones were on the pricey side .
0 as we left the person i was with commented on it too .
0 not very in tune with a patient 's need to know .
0 called tuesday cuz no one called me .
0 so they said come in and get some more different samples .
0 he is a kind doctor but the procedure went horribly wrong .
0 still out $ _num_ plus not including original procedure .
0 nice doctor but horrible experience !
0 i do n't know what happened but this is n't a nail salon .
0 i told them no thanks and left before my appointment .
0 in summary , i was a fan before but now i 've experienced better .
0 a large cheese pizza would probably get you to the moon and back .
0 the ingredients were horrible .
0 the sausage looked more like ground beef , maybe it was .
0 not really sure what to make of that .
0 after a few slices i wished i had had more of the salad bar .
0 it was some of the worst food i have ever had .
0 and the bill , with tax , came to ten bucks flat !
0 if the blood work came back normal , they would need to do x-rays .
0 she tells me it will be $ _num_ .
0 she calls back _num_ mins later and tells me his blood work looks great .
0 _num_ mins later , i get a call ... x-rays look great .
0 ok ... so what 's wrong with him ?
0 so , i pay with my credit card .
0 we called for delivery , they do n't deliver .
0 i ordered the beef with broccoli and _num_ egg rolls .
0 and the beef with broccoli was bland as well .
0 i think she liked hers , she got the almond chicken .
0 she too did n't like the egg rolls .
0 the only reason i tried china china is because of good yelp reviews .
0 sweet and sour combo and i found it to be of low quality .
0 unfortunately china china restaurant is no longer there .
0 the only thing edible was their cut oranges .
0 dropped in to quality bumper a dealership recommendation for some running boards .
0 kept on said he would give me a great deal .
0 so eventually i cracked ... lol i paid for the boards and cover .
0 stated they would call when it was in , probably friday .
0 friday came , saturday went by no word .
0 worst customer service i have ever had .
0 they do not stock some of the most common parts .
0 then he responded sorry i ca n't help you .
0 sadly , a horrible haircut was the result .
0 ummm thanks , but no thanks .
0 do yourself a favor and skip this unprofessional , substandard salon .
0 you 'll only end up disappointed if you do n't .
0 they were very patronizing , snotty and most of all over priced .
0 it 's been such a terrible experience trying to utilize her services we purchased .
0 when we just asked for a refund instead the owner was rude and refused .
0 apparently customer service is n't their strong point .
0 it 's clear they want to turn the salon into a med day spa .
0 they 've run off my business as well .
0 the front desk was very kind and helpful but the dr was very rude .
0 suggested some `` older people '' just can get get used to this type .
0 just got a royal oreo blizzard .
0 what made it royal was it had caramel in it .
0 was told its _num_ cents more because it is a royal blizzard .
0 worse blizzard i have ever eaten and ripped off by the price !
0 i 've been to plenty of jamba juice locations before .
0 but my experience at this particular store was just terrible .
0 i was left waiting in the store for almost half an hour .
0 lady cashier did n't give me my change .
0 manager refused said it 's store policy .
0 horrible customer service today !
0 the guy is ok , the women have their moments .
0 i said u wan na check me !
0 i have more money than ur whole god damn family lady .
0 i do not need to steal anything .
0 i was pretty dissapointed in this whole ordeal !
0 they are ashley pieces , they were pretty when new , but are awful .
0 total waste of money .
0 i purchased carpeting for my nursery from furniture plus .
0 no call , no nothing .
0 again , no call , no nothing .
0 he returned my call and said , oh it wasnt on the truck again .
0 if i could give this place negatives stars i would .
0 the services they provide are pathetic .
0 i 've went her many times because it is closely located to my home .
0 it has failed to impress me on each occasion .
0 speaking of pain , the time i had my acrylics done .
0 after the third one , i asked her to stop .
0 i was so angry !
0 she could have given me a warning .
0 i had to go to the dr. never going again.
0 there are no smiles and no customer service .
0 last few times i 've come here my pizza has been wrong .
0 i could only find _num_ dresses that i was remotely interested in trying on .
0 my sales associate was awkward and did n't even introduce herself .
0 i would not recommend going to this bridal salon .
0 the service is definetly not so hot .
0 i have heard good things about this store and i was greatly disappointed .
0 i was sort of disappointed in suzanne 's bridal .
0 so , instead of saturday , i could take it home on sunday .
0 this only adds so much more stress to my last month before the wedding .
0 i wish , now , i had gone with a different shop .
0 suzanne herself did the alterations and it was perfection .
0 strike three , you 're out .
0 i know weddings do n't go perfectly .
0 the first appointment was a waste .
0 we went back for another appointment , hoping they would be less busy .
0 we waited for about _num_ minutes and no one came to help us .
0 they have terrible customer service .
0 seriously save yourself the time , money , and frustration go anywhere but here !
0 this was my first stop in looking for a wedding dress .
0 she also said they would order the dress 3-4 sizes bigger .
0 i would not recommend this place .
0 they are unpleasant and condescending .

0 so we changed to another italian local place down the road .
0 hoping they change back to original chicken .
0 worst dining experience ever !
0 not from either of us , i and my guest have very close haircuts .
0 am on the fence as to whether or not i can ever return here .

0 she said your bill is $ _num_ .
0 no more bark avenue for me .
0 but she will run off half the wonderful employees and all the regular customers .
0 i do n't feel the quality is in this place .
0 my nails could have been done way better by a salon school .

0 very overpriced and i am rushed through it .
0 sorry you just lost my business .
0 pedicures are still of the same quality i like to get .
0 i will not let that female tech touch my nails again .
0 then when she did come , she was so rude .
0 wow -- what a poor business on customer service and follow-up !
0 watch out if buying from this company .
0 i called david and he told me they could not guarantee a seamless install .
0 i am almost embarrassed to show people my new carpet .
0 it seems to be an installation problem to me .
0 we had carpet installed and sheet vinyl installed .
0 the vinyl came out ok the carpet on the other hand not so good .
0 i get that but these are extreme and i talked to him several times .

0 if your a business owner looking for a new location please stop by .
0 this owner is quickly running this place into the ground .
0 the manager of this store is always grumpy and rude .
0 however , the next day , i was n't so thrilled .
0 but , just be careful .
0 the setting was sub par ... way sub par .
0 it just was n't good .
0 now i just avoid the place .
0 his food was edible , but mine was bad .
0 the food did n't strike me as being overly fresh .
0 the sushi combinations seemed very `` _num_ 's '' and outdated .
0 you could do worse , but you could also do a lot better .
0 this place made me so sick and i have an iron stomach for sushi .
0 the volcano roll was horrible .
0 tasted like old hot canned tuna fish with mayo and cream cheese .
0 i came in specifically for the ginger mahi and they no longer offer it .
0 my friend ordered two sushi rolls that tasted fine but they fell apart .
0 i ordered the salmon that was drenched in teriyaki sauce , it was meh .
0 i 'm really disappointed .

0 the place was packed and there was only one grill available .
0 oh it gets worse .
0 _num_ minutes later , the sushi arrives and is sub par .

0 at that point , i just wanted to go and never return .
0 walked in tonight hoping for sushi dinner for two .
0 poor service - slow , confused , language barrier .
0 `` happy hour '' was extremely limited in terms of drink & food .

0 i did n't like this place much .
0 the portions are ridiculously huge also ... and i mead ridiculous .
0 i do n't understand how this place got such rave reviews .

0 the waitress did n't come back !

0 very disappointing in the quality and flavor of the food .
0 our party ordered a variety of pizza , pasta , salads , steak .
0 flavoring for the dishes we had were all consistent in tasting bland .
0 up until tonight we ate here weekly .

0 within minutes , the other _num_ people arrived with no where to sit .
0 i have been here a few times for work lunches .
0 so far , i have not been impressed .

0 i will not go back there and posted this on facebook as well .
0 the dining area also appeared to be clean , for the most part .

0 still never took our order , said hi or even acknowledged us .

0 worst experience i have ever had in my life .
0 i would have been shocked to find out any different .

0 this location tends to have problems with the food .
0 people are always standing out the door and waiting for food .
0 this staff is never prepared for the dinner rush .
0 this restaurant is always freezing cold and dirty .
0 only reason why we eat here is it is close to our house .

0 safe to say i did n't eat the sandwich .
0 the lady making the food was not interested in working that day .

0 that i was not in or invited to join at this bike shop .
0 the problem was with me .
0 disagree with me if you want , but do n't be arrogant about it .
0 this incident today just sealed it for me .
0 i took it back in , and the mechanic was very apologetic .
0 the bbq meals at the restaurants much better !
0 sorry , but if i see the truck again , i 'll pass by .

0 for our sides we chose green beans , coleslaw , bbq beans .
0 secondly , the pulled pork was stringy , the texture was like hair meat !
0 dry brisket , good fries , not much else .
0 it tasted like it was boiled meat , not bbq .
0 wo n't be coming back here .
0 sorry i tried it .
0 nothing wrong with corn on the cob but how can you make that bad ?
0 i may give it another shot but probably not anytime soon .

0 my stuffed tomato was n't a stuffed tomato .
0 it was thoroughly mediocre .
0 decor is very cheap .
0 the type of view provided and the cheesy decor was almost embarrassing .

0 so disappointed i will not come back here .
0 the people do n't care !
0 the spinach salad my wife had was simple and had pickled artichokes in it .
0 my taco salad was miserable .

0 i do n't like to give bad reviews .
0 just wan na pre warn .
0 pricey for no quality , not even a little quality .
0 orange juice tasted like sunny d .
0 so basically tasted watered down .
0 even the water tasted horrible .
0 no big deal i guess .

0 ca n't go wrong with a beer .
0 i will stick to ordering nachos for every one .
0 i would say that the food here is nothing special .
0 i got the chicken wings which were about $ _num_ and a beer .
0 altogether the bill was $ _num_ .
0 paid for at the time of ordering .
0 no one ever called back to explain or apologize .
0 communication & customer service are obviously not something this company values ... at all .
0 i mean seriously , how hard it so to make a phone call ?
0 we trust home depot , so why not go with the guys they choose .
0 we also confirmed installation date , which was a little over two weeks way .
0 remodeling is n't easy .
0 it 's not quick .
0 this place is terrible .
0 staff is slow , not familiar with things .
0 i 'd give this zero stars if i could .
0 there should n't be any rotten greens in a salad .
0 more black leaves then green leaves .
0 have been here before and the food was ok , smoothie better .
0 they do n't wear gloves here and the store was a complete mess .
0 on various visits , they have been out of straws , cups and soy .
0 we ordered fruit smoothies thinking they would have real fruit in them .
0 ruined a thanksgiving dinner that 's for sure .
0 the steaks were not cheap so we were very disappointed .
0 the beans were good and the cole slaw was ok .
0 i would definitely not go back .
0 my wife ordered a bowl of clam chowder and a small salad .
0 my beans were of the canned variety that they clearly just heat up .
0 they throw away what you ca n't finish .
0 my sister 's four year old was also $ _num_ .
0 apparently , this does not include tickets for the dinner and the show .
0 the children were losing patience !
0 unfortunately , i did n't get to enjoy it .
0 i went there on mother 's day and the family style food was awful .
0 low quality pressed ham with a canned pineapple glaze .

0 i felt really bad for suggesting we go there .

0 an hour passed , meanwhile people around us got their food within _num_ minutes .

0 this was by far the worst experience we have ever had .
0 there was no offer to pay for cleaning .
0 the food was awful and freezing cold .
0 the entertainment was worse .
0 we were expecting to have the gold rush experience .
0 instead we all had a sugar rush instead .
0 the ribs were stringy and full of fat .
0 it was so bad we still had plenty left .
0 what a huge disappointment !
0 the green beans did n't taste fresh , much more like canned vegetables .
0 the cole slaw was n't bad , but was still too sweet .
0 it is as if sugar is the only spice that this restaurant knows .
0 very , very , very disappointing .
0 ate at family style restaurant expecting home made taste , far from that !
0 ham and ribs both poor quality and very bland tasting .
0 would n't mind paying price if food was worth it , but not .
0 will definitely not be back !
0 see why they cater to bus tours , probably only thing keeping them open !
0 i did fail to mention , the rolls were good .
0 everything about this place is disgusting !
0 everything comes with grease dripping hash browns whether you want them or not .
0 my wife and i ate there last night .
0 see my photos for proof , this ai n't no bs !
0 worker 's yelling at each other , dirty !
0 food was bland and cold .
0 avoid this dealership for service .
0 i placed three calls to the service department with no return calls .
0 obviously they are not in need of business .
0 then why didnt they work when we drove it off the lot ?
0 now the air doesnt work and they want _num_ to diagnose the problem .
0 needless to say i got the parts for under _num_ bucks and fixed myself .
0 and this is why trusting dealerships is hard .
0 as we walked away he said it was an honest mistake .
0 do n't get your keys made here - they never work .
0 _num_ different times this has happened .
0 but i was left alone for _num_ minutes .
0 been here several times and been disappointed every time with their plant selection .
0 friendly helpful staff , much more knowledgable than any lowe 's as usual .
0 can you say noisy and smelly ?
0 not a good place for kids .
0 maybe it was the horribly loud music ; maybe the surreal atmosphere .
0 the place smelled greasy and it was so loud we went outside to eat .
0 prices for the chicken was very reasonable .
0 this is just a just a hole .
0 yes , chicken was fried .
0 on a scale of _num_ through _num_ , i would give them a _num_ .
0 a _num_ hour _num_ minute wait with over _num_ hour between seeing the waitress .
0 food reasonable but extremely long wait with no explanation !
0 service and food not worth the wait .
0 wo n't be returning .
0 went and got my own drinks ( two times ) at outside bar .
0 ( very long line there ) .
0 half of the chicken was cold .
0 all the fries were cold .
0 makes more sense to serve everyone happily then not .
0 very disappointed in my service and food today .
0 bad move as we were hungry and thirsty .
0 i ca n't understand why the wait staff is so surly .
0 must be an awful place to work .
0 they just brought it out in a to-go box with no explanation .
0 we were there for _num_ hours .
0 but the service sucks .
0 service quality have gone down prices have gone up .
0 however , the service , unfortunately , could not be any worse !
0 she had a too bad so sad attitude .

0 do n't waste your money or time here !
0 no music and very boring .
0 more of a snow bird or older person hang out .
0 female bartender was very rude .
0 will not go to again .
0 this place is not worth the time .
0 below average food , neighborhood bar atmosphere and service with attitude .
0 but our most recent visit was very poor .
0 it appears the old management has left and started a different restaurant elsewhere .
0 those running it now have truly ruined the place .
0 the salsa was canned and the chips were bagged .
0 service was very poor and we were the only people in the place .
0 we tried this place based on the reviews and were very disappointed .
0 the staff was very friendly but the food was incredibly bland .
0 chicken was dry , beans were flavorless , as was the rice .
0 the incredibly stale chips do n't even begin to fill the void .
0 it 's apparently just a smoking area for the few existing patrons .
0 do n't waste your time here people .
0 the building is old and yuck .
0 the staff are not attentive .
0 i was disappointed that the menu was a limited menu because of the event .
0 this place is racist .
0 _num_ minutes later , still ignored .
0 _num_ month later its full again .
0 and wo n't help us out with this bad service they did for us .
0 would never recommend to anyone find a better company to do business with .
0 they were prompt at getting someone out to my house , thank you .
0 it very slowly went down .
0 this time the woman , was extremely rude .
0 there was obviously an issue that needed to be fixed .
0 after dealing with miss rude , someone showed up about an hour later .
0 he also argued with my _num_ year old neighbor about the entire situation !
0 what a shame , i like to stay with small local businesses when possible .
0 if i could give this a zero star i would .
0 they have a nyc attitude in a small quaint area .
0 i loved apache junction but would steer anyone away from this if i could .
0 no taste whatsoever , the mashed potatoes had to have been instant .
0 i would go here again even if someone else was buying - ish .
0 the beer in the plastic cups was cold .
0 servers were a little slow , but nice .
0 feeling ripped off and wo n't return .
0 yet , i go every year !
0 however , we were horrified that you had a vendor offering elephant rides .
0 the food was pretty gross .
0 the beer for $ _num_ was not outrageous .
0 it was also $ _num_ but tasted like cough syrup and threw it away .
0 it gets pretty busy in the afternoon so we left around 3pm .
0 the only excitement we experienced was getting in the car to go home .
0 like a sucker , i went .
0 i paid my $ _num_ to get in .
0 everyone was laughing and she had no idea that the joke was on her .
0 all of the jokes were in bad taste .
0 and if you are female , you better believe they will .
0 or they simply do n't care ?
0 $ _num_ for an adult ticket gets you absolutely nothing .
0 the food booth offerings are terrible and overpriced .
0 it 's boring , dusty , and overcrowded .
0 did i mention that is was crowded ?
0 can we get our gas money back ?
0 not to mention the half naked women .
0 might return , but i doubt it .
0 the box office refused a refund .
0 it took over _num_ hours to travel from gilbert .
0 it was too crowded .
0 she was nice enough , but that is too crowded .
0 andrea had a horrible attitude from the start .
0 this woman lacked any expertise .
0 are you kidding me ?
0 i explained that the cake was pink .
0 she did n't offer anything to compensate for the error on her part .
0 i would stay away from this business unless you like to gamble .
0 checking back in to make sure people understand how horrible this vendor is .
0 it was thick , doughy and tasteless .
0 the decor is like a cafeteria .
0 patrons are very loud .
0 this is when it got very disappointing .
0 most were very bland while others were just bad .
0 the other dish was poorly executed and just tasted bad .
0 overall , the place was really bad .
0 i did n't see a single korean there eating which is a bad sign .
0 worst korean food i 've ever eaten without question .
0 but yesterday i was thoroughly disappointed .
0 the fish was stale and gray .
0 i could have brought in fresher ginger .
0 this was not bulgogi .
0 if you decide to go there and get disappointed , do n't blame me .
0 i hated this place .
0 i tried to go beyond that and ordered _num_ different dishes .
0 therefore , i 'm no expert on it 's taste , etc .
0 i felt this place as overpriced for the size of the portions .
0 the food did n't seem to be very fresh , but old .
0 on the side note , i noticed a lot of asian people in there .
0 ignored for a good _num_ minutes in a half empty restaurant .
0 _num_ % of service to _num_ % of the tables .
0 at least the food was n't as underwhelming as the service .
0 i ca n't deny the place did have an odor .
0 waited _num_ minutes for the check , .
0 worst yet , i had terrible diarrhea the next day .
0 the decor of the restaurant could use a bit of a remodel .
0 korean food is mediocre for a restaurant stating its specialty in korean food .
0 but the second time was my final visit .
0 food was ok , bulgogi was a little too sweet .
0 could have used a little spice in it .
0 they kinda apologized , but not really .
0 the sushi had way too much rice , three times the normal .
0 the fish was not fresh and the mix of flavors were weird .
0 the gyoza dumplings were very greasy and had minimum filling .
0 overall , i would n't recommend the sushi here to my worst enemy .
0 this is a korean restaurant and they should stick to what they do best .
0 especially given the _num_ % gratuity they hit us with for a large group .
0 the sushi itself was extremely underwhelming .
0 the sushi was essentially a big rice roll with little to no fish .
0 all in all , i was not impressed .
0 update : sadly i will not be coming back here again .
0 but what we experienced was downright unacceptable .
0 trying to cash out or get a check was a nightmare .
0 we probably made a mistake ordering sushi at a korean bbq joint .

0 the food and the service was horrible .
0 it was my first time , but was not impressed .
0 there are a few servers left from the old owner but they hate it .
0 well , where do i begin ?
0 and for that i wish i could give it a zero !
0 this is the reason i will never go back .
0 the gentleman said they closed at 9:30 ... did n't seem right .
0 the pork was ok , not terrible .
0 this review gets _num_ stars instead of _num_ because she was friendly and nice .
0 for some reason today , was the worse experience i 've had here .
0 the server and was extremely rude .
0 this place is not the cleanest restaurant in town .
0 the floor was sticky when we walked into our booth .
0 we sat down and was greeted by the server .
0 this was our place to go for years and we were never disappointed .
0 we so wish that it could go back to the way it was .
0 my biggest problem with this place is that it is dirty .
0 sure , i guess you ca n't remember or write it down .
0 so i 'm out almost double of what we were supposed to pay .
0 they should have just refunded me back the cost of the plate .
0 i 'm really unsatisfied with this restaurant , but i still paid gratuity .

0 could n't eat most of it .
0 the chef did n't speak english and would just yell at us .
0 customer service could 've been better .
0 other than that , i have n't gone back because of the customer service .

0 well , if the shoe fits ... they were awful .
0 the management staff turned over quicker than a fast food joint .
0 it was a second floor unit , which was wrong .
0 a `` mandatory '' $ _num_ for some stupid trash service .
0 i 'm a _num_ ear old guy .
0 i can take my own trash out .
0 is n't that what rent is for ?
0 they never mentioned any of these fees upon walk through .
0 even when moving out , no one had a clue .
0 it 's a shady area with shady people and is no way luxury .
0 how can a company flat out not care about it 's people ?
0 do n't ever consider moving here .
0 this place is a complete joke .
0 i can not stress enough , do your research and look elsewhere .
0 pretty frustrating when they give you the run around .
0 there 's no way out of that contract .
0 _num_ word for this place - nope !
0 avoid at all costs .
0 do n't move here even if it 's free .
0 this place is awful !
0 this place is horrible .
0 the office employees are not very bright .
0 and that was with constant calling and going down to the office .
0 then they act like they ca n't be bothered with you or your problems .
0 i would not refer this apartment complex to anyone .
